excerpt: "Headed off to Creve Couer park again tonight after work. I did my first mile in 4:37 or something close to that, second mine I had done by 9:00. Third mile i hit a brick wall. My shins started to get tired out, which rarely happens when&#160;I skate anymore. I think the third mile took me over 6:30 to do, the wind sure didn't help,&#160;I might have been better off doing my normal look backwards today. I ended up doing the 4.79 mile loop in less time than I did on Wednesday, though I don't know the exact number off the top of my head, I think I was only 9-10 seconds faster due to the wind and pain! I'll plug my forerunner in later and see what the exact numbers were."
