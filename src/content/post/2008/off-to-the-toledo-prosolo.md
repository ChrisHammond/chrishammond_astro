excerpt: "I'm headed to bed, hoping for 8 hours sleep, though if I want to leave at 6am I'm not going to get it! I've got the car loaded, but still have to do a bit of packing of clothing in the morning.   The Corvette should get a workout this weekend, 2 drivers in SS and 1 driver in SM2!  I'll post from Toledo later this weekend. "
