excerpt: "A few weeks ago at St. Pat's some of my fraternity brother's were giving me trouble about owning the Corvette. They thought if I owned the Corvette I also needed to have a Mustache. Well here it is, probably the only mustache I will ever grow.  Natalie loves it (not). I think it looks great (not). It is coming off in the morning (so)!"
