So I made it back from Boston in one piece today, my mother-in-law picked me up from the airport and brought me home so I could drop my things off and head to the office.
  
I made it there for a few hours, got some loose ends tied up from the past week and started planning for the next two weeks. It looks like I will be headed to Dubai soon, I should know more tomorrow hopefully as to when, right now it looks like I will miss the Bloomington IL user group meeting I was supposed to present at on 10/14, but I’ve lined up a replacement speaker assuming the user group takes him!
  
So yesterday Carol and I went to the ball game at Fenway, here’s a quick photo I snapped there, tweaked a little bit for effect, though not sure if it is the effect I was going for.
