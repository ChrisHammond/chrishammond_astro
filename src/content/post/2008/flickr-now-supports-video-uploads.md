excerpt: "If this isn't just one of the coolest things of 2008 I don't know what is. Flickr now allows for video uploads!!! What's the big deal you might ask, there are already other video services, well I am a huge fan of Flickr, and would much rather upload my videos to Flickr, the same place I upload all my photos. Their clips have&#160;a maximum length of 90 seconds, PERFECT for autocross runs! &#160;        The above video is my first upload for Flickr. It's actually a very poor video, the camera mount I used this past weekend frankly sucks! I'll hopefully get a new one tomorrow. "
