excerpt: "Earlier today I started working on a new DotNetNuke Module that displays Flickr Photos.  The initial version is posted on my photos page so you can see my 50 most recent Flickr photos. There is still a lot left to do with this module, but at least it is displaying photos for now.  https://www.chrishammond.com/photos.aspx "
