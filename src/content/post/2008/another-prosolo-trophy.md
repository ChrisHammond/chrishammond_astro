<p>It might not be in my usual class but it is a ProSolo trophy nonetheless! I placed 4th in the Washington DC ProSolo this weekend in&#160;ESP. It was a fun class to run in with the positions changing quite a bit both days.</p> <p>Now I'm working for a week here in Baltimore then fly to Indy to rent a car and drive up to the Peru National Tour to find my Corvette and hopefully see how well I do against the top level competition that is lined up for Peru.</p>
