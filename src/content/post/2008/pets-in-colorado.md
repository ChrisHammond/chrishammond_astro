excerpt: "Time for another installment in our adventures in moving to Colorado. It's late so this won't be a large installment, but hopefully a useful one into our thinking about our move.  One important aspect about our move will be our pets. Right now that means two dogs, two horses and one cat. Eventually that might mean only one horse, but the horse will probably be one of the most important factors in choosing a location in Colorado.  "
