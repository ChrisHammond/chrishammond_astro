excerpt: "So you might wonder, why are we planning on moving. Days like today are why. It was in the upper 80s today, which in itself wouldn't be too bad, but the humidity was high all day long, with more of the same scheduled for tomorrow. The weather here in Missouri is one of the main reasons we're planning on moving. Personally, I am sick and tired of the humidity, as I believe Natalie is also. We're looking forward to better weather in the summers in Colorado, and then hopefully beautiful winters as well!"
