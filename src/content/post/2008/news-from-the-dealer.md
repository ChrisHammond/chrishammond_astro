excerpt: "So, this week just got really expensive, and I haven't even left for Topeka yet! $4-500 for the St. Louis dealer, plus $$ to get the rear control arms replaced, though I am going to have the control arms replaced by Superior Chevy out in Meriam Kansas because they can do it Thursday morning and they are SCCA Folk, I trust them way more than the local guys to get me corrected properly. A big thanks to Jeff Kopp out there at Superior for helping me out. I'll post more later after I get over the fact that I'm going to be dropping another $2k into John's car! :)"
