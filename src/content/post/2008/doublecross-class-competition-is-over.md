excerpt: "The doublecross class competition is over. I ended up 5th, Nick in 10th. I had a redlight run that I pushed, was one of the fastest times on that side of the course, so I am happy with that. Nick had cleanliness issues today.   Tomorrow we do a 5 bracket competition, I seeded 48th overall, so I'll be running against the 113th seed, an SM2 RX-7. "
