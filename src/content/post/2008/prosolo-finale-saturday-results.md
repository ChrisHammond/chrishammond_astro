excerpt: "Well I managed to fall one position today into 8th place. I was faster on the left side, but managed to redlight that run as I changed where I was launching from and got a much better launch than I expected. I picked up 3tenths or so on the right side. I would have moved up to 6th had I not redlighted that run. Oh well, maybe another year! "

<p>Well I managed to fall one position today into 8th place. I was faster on the left side, but managed to redlight that run as I changed where I was launching from and got a much better launch than I expected. I picked up 3tenths or so on the right side. I would have moved up to 6th had I not redlighted that run. Oh well, maybe another year!</p>
