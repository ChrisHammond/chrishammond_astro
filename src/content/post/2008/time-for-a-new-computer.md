<p>It really is about time for a new computer. I spent the day at home working on a paper and presentation that was due for class tonight, and about an hour before I needed to leave the computer went haywire. Hasn't been the same since.</p> <p>Unfortunately I think I need to reformat and reinstall Vista to get it all in working order again....</p> <p>Looks like I'll have to do our taxes on the laptop tomorrow night.</p>
