excerpt: "It always seems that one project always leads to another, and I'm usually lucky if that other is only one.  First I started on my Flickr module for this website.  That leads to me needing to setup SQL server, that leads me to wanting to setup a server in the basement with SQL server on it.  Which leads me to (for a brief moment) think of buying a Windows Home Server from Circuity City.  Luckily I stopped with the thoughts of buying a new machine for now.  At the moment I'm trying to install an eval version of Windows Home Server on an old machine in the basement with a new hard drive I bought today, which leads me to the question.  Where do my mice go when they die? I can't find a PS2 mouse in this house to save my life, now to see if a wireless USB mouse will do what I need, as I can't get past the license agreement screen without a mouse.... Bad UI MS "
