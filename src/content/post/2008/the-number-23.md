<p>Anyone seen the movie Number 23? I started watching it, but didn't get more than a few minutes into it before Natalie decided she wanted to watch American Idol. One thing I noticed in the opening credits.</p> <p>George Herbert Walker Bush</p> <p>William Jefferson Clinton</p> <p>are names of two past presidents and their names are both 23 characters long.</p> <p>Christopher Jason Hammond, did you count it? 23</p> <p>That's right!</p>
