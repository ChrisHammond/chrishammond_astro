Natalie and I are looking at heading out to Colorado for a trip to start looking around and seeing what areas we might want to live when we move later in 2009. We had planned to go in December but with school and work I wasn't able to make the time for a trip. We're now thinking about going at the end of the month. With New Years Eve and New Years Day we could leave Tuesday night or Wednesday and I would only have to miss one day of work, Friday the 2nd. That would give us 4 or 5 days out there to look around.
