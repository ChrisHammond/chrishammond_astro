excerpt: "So I guess I didn't need any practice going into the Atlanta Pro Solo next weekend (aka Doublecross). It was raining and windy this morning when I left the house, but I had every intention of running the event out at Gateway Raceway.  I get out there and I see that there are no cones on the lot for a course, and it looks like people are leaving. Sure enough, the damn event was cancelled. I hung around the lot for 20-30 minutes to chat with the stragglers who were still there, and those who were showing up.   "

<p>So I guess I didn't need any practice going into the Atlanta Pro Solo next weekend (aka Doublecross). It was raining and windy this morning when I left the house, but I had every intention of running the event out at Gateway Raceway.</p> <p>I get out there and I see that there are no cones on the lot for a course, and it looks like people are leaving. Sure enough, the damn event was cancelled. I hung around the lot for 20-30 minutes to chat with the stragglers who were still there, and those who were showing up.</p> <p>After that&#160;I headed home and decided to do a little coding. Early on a Sunday morning, working on code, not something I'm accustomed to, but I made some good progress on a module I've been working on for a few days now. It's for my secret project, so I can't say anything more about it, but I do hope to get that project launched this week, possibly even Monday, though likely later.</p> <p>Natalie and I watched an hour or so of Transformers that was on cinemax HD while I was doing some work. After that we headed to the good ole Tropical Smoothie Cafe in Des Peres. The usually weekday staff was nowhere to be found, this time they were staffed by what looked to be a few high school girls. The one who took our order sure didn't look like she&#160;wanted to be at work on Sunday afternoon.</p> <p>From there we headed out to Grey's Summit Missouri to take a look at a house. It was actually a pretty nice house, $250k range, 5 acres of what looked to be very usable land. It might even have a LARGE outbuilding with room for two RVs, which would probably make a great workshop/garage. Though we aren't sure if the building is part of the property or not. There were two other issues, one right now being the driveway leading to the house, and to the outbuilding, is all gravel. I drove the vette down this road, and would not want to do that on a daily basis. Two, the house is only 3 bedrooms, and looks somewhat small, though, being out in Franklin County, and with 5 cleared acres, I have to wonder if adding on wouldn't be an issue in the future? Here are two front pictures, I didn't take any from the rear.</p> <p><a title="IMG_5696" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2485524788/"><img class="pc_img" height="160" alt="IMG_5696" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2229/2485524788_b133015f05_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>&#160;<a title="IMG_5705" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2485527322/"><img class="pc_img" height="160" alt="IMG_5705" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3259/2485527322_1603eeafbc_m.jpg" width="240" /></a></p> <p>After that we headed off to the bro/sis-in-law's house for a little mother's day gathering. I tormented my neice as a good uncle should. At least I think one should, I didn't really have any uncles growing up!</p> <p>This evening we came home and I have spent a few hours in the office again. Cleaning up my desk, organizing papers, working with photos, music, and now I'm going to get back to coding my module. Probably another hour's worth of work tonight, then I'll head to bed. Before midnight for a rare occassion.</p>
