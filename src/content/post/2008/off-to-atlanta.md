<p>I'm headed off to Atlanta in the morning. 6am flight, that's going to suck a bit. I'll be there till my 8pm flight tomorrow night. Hopefully everything will go smoothly with no delays. I'm hoping to leave for the Newport ProSolo early friday morning, so the earlier I get back on Thursday night the better.</p>
