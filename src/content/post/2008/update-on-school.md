excerpt: "Well I went to school this evening and dropped a course. I realized I was going to be missing 8-10 classes in this course alone this fall due to all of the trips scheduled, so I figured I would take some of my load off and only have one course this fall, intermediate micro. I still have a course to finish up from this summer, before the end of the fall semester, and after all the conferences and traveling are done I will probably sign up for an online course. That will leave me two classes left next spring to finish up my BS in Economics.   "
