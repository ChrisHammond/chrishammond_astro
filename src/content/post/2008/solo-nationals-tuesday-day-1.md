excerpt: "So I am exhausted and won't be making this a long blog post. Today was Day #1 of the SCCA TireRack Solo Nationals. I spent almost all day today in the timing trailers trying, with Darrin, to make the live results functionality work. Unfortunately we were unable to get it working! After that I met up with Natalie as she arrived today shortly afternoon, I took her to where she needed to check in to her work assignment, then sent her off to work on the course for a heat (her work assignment). For the fifth heat we both worked in the announce vehicle for the West course, I announced while she helped me keep track of the cone counts on the cars on course. It was fun, my first time announcing for the Solo Nationals, hopefully not my last! After working we walked the West course, stopped to chat with a few friends in grid and the paddock, then made our way back to the hotel to meet up with my Dad who arrived for his first trip to the Solo Nationals. I've been trying for years to get him to come, I'm glad he has finally made it to Topeka! Perhaps someday I can get him to race. Now it is time for bed, perhaps another blog post tomorrow."
