excerpt: "I don't know any of the facts, but I'm going to say that it has rained here more this year than any other year. I really need to buy some new wiper blades for the vehicles, they all need to be replaced.   At least I get to see the fresh wax on all the rides in action with all the rain! "

<p>I don't know any of the facts, but I'm going to say that it has rained here more this year than any other year. I really need to buy some new wiper blades for the vehicles, they all need to be replaced.</p> <p>At least I get to see the fresh wax on all the rides in action with all the rain! We're supposed to have another softball game tomorrow night, and it is supposed to rain. Rain this weekend, race on Sunday. I think we need to get rain tires soon.</p>
