<p>It&#39;s 12:25am on Wednesday April 30th, 2008, and I just realized I have failed. Through April 28th of this year I managed to blog here on ChrisHammond.com at least once per day, even if it was a tiny blog post I had managed to make at least that every day of the year.</p>  <p>On the 29th of April, I failed to post a single blog here, I&#39;ve failed. My goal was to make it all year long with at least one post per day here.</p>  <p>I did manage to make a few blog posts on other sites, <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">www.dotnetnuke.com</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.project240z.com">www.project240z.com</a>, along with a secret website I hope to &quot;announce&quot; later this week.</p>  <p>So my streak of blogging once a day all year is still alive, but not here on my personal website. This actually disappoints me greatly, I was really being good about posting, even when I&#39;ve been out of town with limited internet access.</p>
