excerpt: "Being out of town I don't have access to some of the hardware that I need to put the video together from this past weekend at the Atlanta ProSolo. I will spend some time next week doing that, as well as working with the video I take at the National Tour this weekend.  For now though, you can check out a video that I put together a few weeks ago working in the garage.    "
