excerpt: "So the headline is a little early, but we all know the inevitable will happen. I've always been a Bonds hater, I don't like the guy, don't think he should get the opportunity to break the record. But I've also come to accept that it will happen, and I'm going to try to be there! I've got two Standing Room tickets to the game on Sunday. I don't plan on using them, there's a race on Sunday. But if by chance Barry Bonds hits 2-3 homers Friday and Saturday that will put him within reach of Hank Aaron's record on Sunday, and for that I'll miss, or leave early, the race. Â "
