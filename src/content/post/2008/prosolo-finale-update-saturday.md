<p>One word summary? Wet</p> <p>More details: lots of rain!</p> <p>I'm sitting in 7th place after my runs today, my runs were better than I expected after the "practice" runs we ended up having this morning. We'll see what happens tomorrow but I believe it is still going to rain. If it dries up at all it could get really interesting tomorrow.</p>
