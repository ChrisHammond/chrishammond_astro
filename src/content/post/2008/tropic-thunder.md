<p>Another movie review from the Hammond family. Natalie and I went to see Tropic Thunder tonight, eh, it was so-so, not too great, but not too bad either. I must say, I was thinking lately that I haven't enjoyed Stiller movies, now I am pretty sure I just don't like the guy's work. I think Something About Mary was his one and only good role.</p>
