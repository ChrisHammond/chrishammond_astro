excerpt: "I think this is the fourth or fifth week of the show, and I must say I am still in love with it. Wipeout is a hilarious show. I've watched I believe every episode this summer, and while the show changes a little bit each week it is funny every time. If you haven't seen it before I highly recommend watching it next Wednesday on ABC."
