excerpt: "I posted this on the DotNetNuke.com forums, but figured it was appropriate on my blog as well. On my recent trip overseas I had a few people ask me who I was voting for, and they were shocked when I said John McCain. I'm a republican through and through, the son of a Colonel in the United States Air Force I've always been and will most likely always be a Republican. While I don't always follow the party line on some of the most controversial topics I will believe the Republican&#160;party is the best choice for the long term success of this Nation. Get out and vote for John McCain!"
