excerpt: "So I haven’t blogged in a few days, it’s busy here in Dubai! I haven’t seen too much, though Derek did drive me around a little bit to see some of the buildings. It is amazing how much haze there is here, I call it smog though, it’s actually kind of disgusting, doesn’t make for pretty views in what could be a very pretty skyline(s). I say skylines because there appears to be many different skylines here in Dubai, as there are groupings of large buildings spread out all over the place.  It’s Monday here, day 2 of the workweek here, we’re heading off to the client shortly, I just spent the past 20 minutes ironing my shirts for the week. It took some effort to get the ironing board up here finally.  Before I go, I’ll comment on the topic of this blog. The mirror in the bathroom doesn’t fog, at least I haven’t been able to make it do so. The thing is heated! It’s pretty cool I must say, when we buy/build a house we’ll have to look into this as an option! So long for now"
