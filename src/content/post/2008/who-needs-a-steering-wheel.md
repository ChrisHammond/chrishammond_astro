<p>Over the time working on the 240Z we had various problems getting the steering wheel mounted in the car properly. The steering column threads wouldn't allow the Nut that I had to thread onto the column so mounting the wheel was an issue.</p> <p>Last night I found another nut for the column and believed that I got it threaded onto the column with a lot of brute force. Well it ends up that brute force basically destroyed the threads on the column. So... I guess I'll add a new steering column to the list of things&nbsp;I need for the car.</p>
