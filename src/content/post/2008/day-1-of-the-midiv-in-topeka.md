<p>Today started very early, 3:52 early when Dave called me and woke me up on his way to pick me up, we were on the road by 4:30 or so. We got into the Topeka area just around 8:30am and stopped by the car wash to give the car a quick spray. From there it was off to Heartland Park to get things rolling.</p>  <p>We ended up working before we ran in the Test&amp;Tune, it was hot pretty much all day, even earlier in the morning. Both Dave and I had issues today with the car. The first mistake was made on Wednesday before loading it up on the trailer, I forgot to fill the car up with gas, so we ran today starting at a quarter of a tank. I don't know if this was the cause, or the poor surface conditions here at Heartland Park but I spun the car on my first 2 runs, and then again 4 or 5 more times, I think I had 4 runs without spins and probably 7 runs that had spins.</p>  <p>I also managed to hit a ton of cones. Midway through the day I was ready to call it quits and drive home, it would have been more comfortable, it was a damn hot day today. Hopefully tomorrow will be a bit better, but we will see. We're running first heat, so hopefully we'll get the coolest runs of the day, though that will most likely mean the surface will be nice and sandy.</p>  <p>I had some video today that I was going to try to get posted, but I managed to delete it from the hard drive and the compact flash, lesson learned!</p>
