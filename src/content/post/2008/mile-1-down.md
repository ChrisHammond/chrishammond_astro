<P>So 2008, the Year of the Hobby, is also the year of the fitness!</P> <P>Goal: Run 1 mile, consecutively, by the end of January.&nbsp;2 miles in February, building up to 12 by the end of the year.....</P> <P>Tonight I went to the YMCA for the first time (to our local one rather than Chesterfield to play racquetball). I ran around the track. I ran 1/3rd a mile, walked 1/6th, ran 1/6th, walked 1/6th, ran 1/6th. Walked 1/9th, ran 1/18th.</P> <P>Total running 13/18ths of a mile. Tomorrow, repeat the process.</P> <P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
