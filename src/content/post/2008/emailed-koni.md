<p>Well, after <a href="https://www.corvettez06.org/tabid/80/itemid/63/What-is-it-with-me-and-Koni-shocks.aspx">the fiasco with my brand new shocks last week</a> I emailed Koni to see what kind of support I might be able to get from them! I'll post more when I hear back from them. Here's hoping for the best!</p>
