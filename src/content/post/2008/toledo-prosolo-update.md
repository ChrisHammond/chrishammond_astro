<p>Quick update: Got home about an hour and a half ago, 8 hour drive, the POS Ford check engine light came on again.</p> <p>The Corvette Z06 team filled in the <strike>top</strike> bottom&#160;two places at the Toledo ProSolo... Not much good to be said of the weekend, except I got some good spin footage to add to the White Tornado collection.</p> <p>I'll be working on video from last weekend and this weekend over the next few days to get all the runs posted.</p>
