<P>So the biggest headache I'm going to have with my conversion from CommunityServer to DotNetNuke is going to be how I get DNN to accept or handle&nbsp;the old CommunityServer URLs. Why do I need to do this? Because Google, and all of the other Search Engines out there eat this site for lunch, they love all the content on here, and if I don't provide direct replacements for each URL I'll take a HUGE hit in referrals from the search engines, which will directly effect revenue generation from the Adsense here.</P> <P>I need to pick a few brains tomorrow to figure out how I'm going to do this.</P>
