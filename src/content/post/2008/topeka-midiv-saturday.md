<p>Today was an interesting day. It was once again hot hot hot today. I managed to get faster on all of my runs, and my last run would have put me in 2nd but I picked up a cone in the last 25% of the course, so I had to sit on my third run. Dave did the same thing, though his third run was faster than mine. I believe we're sitting in 4th and 5th right now.</p> <p>We'll see how Sunday goes. I'll see if I can't get video going later tonight, we're heading off to the banquet for dinner shortly.</p>
