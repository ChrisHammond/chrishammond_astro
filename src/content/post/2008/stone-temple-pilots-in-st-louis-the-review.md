excerpt: "A short review for tonight, perhaps a longer one in the morning, perhaps not.  Ashes Divide, eh, not a fan. They performed well, I'm just not a big fan of their music.  Saliva, great live, I might have to buy an album of theirs on my Zune this week.  Chevelle, good show live, sounded great, but not a huge fan of their music, I have one album, not likely to buy another soon.  STP, amazing, great show as always. My first concert back in 1994 was STP at Arco Arena in Sacramento. This show wasn't as flashy but still good nonetheless. I think this is my third time seeing STP, and 4th Scott, I will definitely make the trip again sometime if given the chance.  We were sitting in what amounted to the 5th or 6th row, in front of that was the \"mosh\" pit, but I can't say I saw any moshing today.  I shot some video on my phone, will try to upload it tomorrow if it turned out at all. "
