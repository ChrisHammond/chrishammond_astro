<p>Wow, I was just about to head to bed when I saw <a href="https://zuneinsider.com/archive/2008/05/06/zune-spring-update.aspx">this post</a> from <a href="https://www.zuneinsider.com/">Cesar over at Zune Insider</a>.</p> <p>Great news, the spring update for the Zune is here, or almost here. I'm looking forward to&#160;these specific updates.</p> <p>1. Editing Album/Track Info<br /> 2. Downloadable TV Shows <br /> 3. Gapless Playback!</p> <p>Item #2 could turn out to be really interesting. If they offer all the TV shows as part of the Zune Pass, monthly subscription, I might just sign myself up for that!</p> <p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/may08/05-05Zune25PR.mspx">Read about more of the features here</a></p>
