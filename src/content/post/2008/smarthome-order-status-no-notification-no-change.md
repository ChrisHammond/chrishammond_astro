<p>Well last week we posted about ordering an SDK for Insteon from Smarthome.com. Since that order we haven't heard a single word from Smarthome... No update on the order beyond my initial email that I received for confirmation. Their website says the order is "open". I guess in the year 2008 I expect more from a company, perhaps a response, thanks, we'll have your products in sometime soon.</p> <p>I guess we'll have to give them a call tomorrow and see what the status actually is for ourselves.</p>
