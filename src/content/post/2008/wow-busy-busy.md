<p>Well I am not too busy busy, but Solo Performance sure is. I'm sitting here using their internet and trying to work on my book proposal, they are the official source for SCCA Apparel and Merchandise, so they have a TON of merchandise here for the Solo Nationals. There are people coming and going constantly!</p>
