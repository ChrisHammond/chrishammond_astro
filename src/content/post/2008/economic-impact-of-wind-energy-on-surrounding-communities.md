<p>I am finally working on my economics paper that I need to finish up before the end of the semester. I hate that it has taken me this long to get started, but with all of my travelling this semester I've not had any free time to do this. The topic is "The&#160;Economic Impact of Wind Energy on Surrounding Communities", if you have any information you think might be useful for my paper please feel free to send it my way!</p>
