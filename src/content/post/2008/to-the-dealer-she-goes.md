<p>A few hours from now (5-6) I hope to have the car at a local Chevy dealer. I will be dropping it off with the hopes that they can get it repaired by Wednesday. I still don't know what the problem with the car is, though I did manage to do some more damage today while trying to tighten up the rear end. I managed to break one of the two bolds in this photo (photo not of my car) the bolt on the bottom left, right in front of the wood blocks, I was trying to tighten things down and snap went the bolt :(</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://www.c5frc.com/photogallery/Clutch%20Install/photogallery/18.JPG" /></p> <p>I'll post more updates tomorrow as I get more info from the dealer. I had really hoped to have a nice relaxing weekend, but this was far from relaxing stressing out over the car being trouble, Nationals coming up and selling the car. John (the guy buying the car)&#160;sure doesn't want a broken car, and I sure don't want to miss Nationals this year because of car troubles, hopefully the dealer can fix whatever is wrong without hurting me too bad on the cost.</p>
