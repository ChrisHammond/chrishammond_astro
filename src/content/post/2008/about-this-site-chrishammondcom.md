<p><a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/blog/itemid/1045/conversion-process-from-communityserver-to-dotnetn">for an overview of how this site came to run on DotNetNuke, after running on CommunityServer for a few years read this blog post.</a></p>  <p>This website runs on the latest version of <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a> Community Edition 4.9.2 (9.13.03 currently), and the Engage: Publish module from <a href="https://www.engagesoftware.com">www.engagesoftware.com</a>. For URL&nbsp;cleanup I&nbsp;use URL&nbsp;Master from Ifinity (no longer using ifinity).</p>  <p>For a few years the site ran on variations of the CommunityServer platform but due to the platform&#39;s licensing changes I decided to convert from CommunityServer to DotNetNuke.</p>  <p>The fact that I am a DotNetNuke Core Team Member also had a little to do with that as well.</p>  <p>If you&#39;re looking for a personal website, DNN is a great platform for building that out. I am partial to the Engage Publish module (<a href="https://github.com/ChrisHammond/EngagePublish">my fork</a>) for the actual content. I&#39;ve maintained that module for nearly 20 years now and continue to make updates to it regularly.&nbsp;</p>
