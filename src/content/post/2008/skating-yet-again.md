excerpt: "I went to the park again tonight. Ouch! I did my first two miles in pretty good time, I think around 9 minutes, but once again I hit a wall of wind on the last 2.8 miles of my skate. I think I'll try skating the opposite way tomorrow if it is windy again. I was quite a bit slower today as well with the wind. Before I skate again I'm going to adjust my frames a bit on my skates. I rotated wheels on Sunday before Natalie and I skated, I'm not sure I like how I adjusted the frame, it makes me a bit more unsteady."
