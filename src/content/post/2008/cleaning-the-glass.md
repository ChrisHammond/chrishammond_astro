excerpt: "This morning I got under the front of the Z06 to see if I could finally track down the rattles and squeaks. I took the front sway bar off and relubed the bushings, after putting everything back together and tightening things up it still squeaks and rattles. It might be a little better, though I'm not sure if I have done anything but settle my mind on some of the suspension components being loose. My guess now is that the end links are noisy, now to figure out how to check those out and stop it. "
