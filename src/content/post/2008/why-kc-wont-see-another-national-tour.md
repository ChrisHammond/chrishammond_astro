<p>Reason #1? Because Competitors get shot before the event. Unfortunately one&#160;of the CP competitors was involved in an attempted car jacking this morning that turned into a shooting. Lots of rumors about what happened, not quite sure what all really went down, but&#160; I do know that Amo was shot in the leg, and the suspects got away. <a href="https://www.kmbc.com/news/17347796/detail.html">https://www.kmbc.com/news/17347796/detail.html</a></p> <p>While this didn't happen at the event, it happened less than a quarter mile away from the site.</p>
