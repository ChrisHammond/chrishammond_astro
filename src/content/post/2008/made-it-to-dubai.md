<p>So I made the trip to Dubai fine this evening. The three of us in my section were all American, I was next to two guys, my guess is they were oil workers heading off to Baghdad, but they weren’t too talkative so that I could find out.</p>  <p>It’s hot here, I’m not gonna like that part. So far I can’t get to <a href="https://www.flickr.com">www.flickr.com</a> and some TV show on BBC was blocked. I am going to miss the freedom of America these next 10 days.</p>  <p>The first car I noticed here in Dubai, besides the hundreds of taxis, a Corvette of course.</p>
