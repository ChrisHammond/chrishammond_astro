<p>Another local event down, and another reminder of a couple of things</p> <p>1) St. Louis in the summer sucks<br /> 2) Racing in the summer in St. Louis sucks</p> <p>Heat and humidity!</p> <p>Nonetheless, it was a good event, I still need to drive faster, but I did manage to take FTD (fastest time of day) as well as the top Index position, and first place in Super Stock. Dave finished 2nd in SS. Beth took first in SSL and also took the top Ladies Index spot.</p> <p>That makes two local events that the CorvetteZ06.org team has taken the top index and ladies index positions here in St. Louis. Next stop, Topeka Kansas for the Midiv Championships next week!</p>
