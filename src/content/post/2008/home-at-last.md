<p>I'm finally home! The car is in the garage, albeit with numbers and race tires still on, but at least it is home and covered again.</p> <p>My computer apparently freaked out last night, I couldn't connect to it this morning from the hotel so I figured it just needed rebooted. So far, rebooting doesn't help. I can boot in safe mode, and hopefully make this post, but I can't get it to boot up normally, and it doesn't give me any errors either. Not sure what to try next...</p> <p>Update: I've managed to get back up and running, though with a Beta driver from NVidia, which is now causing some annoying mouse slow down issues.</p>
