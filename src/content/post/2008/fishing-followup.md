<p>Well I had planned to do a fishing follow up today, but it's 11:30 and I really don't feel like typing one up now! Basically, we fished Lake of the Ozarks on Saturday, I think I caught 4, 1 blue gill and 3 crappie, no bass whatsoever.</p> <p>Today I slept till 11am and then washed/clay barred/waxed the Envoy, it looks pretty damn good if I do say so myself. Now, if I could just get the Corvette done in the next week or two.</p>
