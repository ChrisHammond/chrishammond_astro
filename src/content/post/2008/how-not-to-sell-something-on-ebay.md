excerpt: "So last weekend some of the items I sold on Ebay for the 240Z ended. Well I shipped the last item off today, and I'm pretty sure, because of how badly I estimated shipping costs, I didn't make a dime on the deal. If anything I lost money.  Tip: When selling something on ebay, always box it up, and weigh it before you start the auction. That way you can calculate proper shipping. Today I shipped off a box of interior parts that someone bought for .99 and paid $15 for shipping. I had to pay $65 to ship the damn thing because the box I had to use was so big.  Lesson learned. "
