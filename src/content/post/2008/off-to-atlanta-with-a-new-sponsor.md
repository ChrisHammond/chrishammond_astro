excerpt: "Well, less than 24 hours from now Nick and I will be on the road to Atlanta. We're planning on pulling out of St. Louis around 3am, but we'll see how that goes. I will have a lot to do tonight to get ready. Load the car on the trailer, pack the van. Yup, VAN, I'm taking the SoloPerformance.com Church Van down to Atlanta. Much thanks to Dave for the loaner tow vehicle! I mounted up the tires on the old street wheels last night. New Hoosier rubber for this weekend, hopefully we can get down in time to do some practice starts and get some of the new tire mold off. It should be a fun weekend, and hopefully I'll have some great videos together. A big thanks to CorvetteZ06.org's Newest Sponsor, Chase Cam, www.chasecam.com. I've usedÂ Chase Cam equipment many times throughout the years and now get the chance to work with some of their newest equipment, needless to say I am stoked! See you all in Atlanta!"
