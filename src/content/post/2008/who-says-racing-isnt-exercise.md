excerpt: "So at the National Tour in Cecil Georgia this past weekend I took my Garmin Forerunner 305. Why? Because I wanted to use the heart rate monitor and see what my heart rate gets to when I race. I wore it on Sunday, when walking the course and then when taking my runs. It's interesting, you can see my heartrate steadily climb over a run. On my third and final run my heart rate peaked at 171bpm. It's been two weeks since I've run, but that is about 10bpm lower than what is my high generally when running. I'm trying to get the event uploaded to motionbased.com so that I can link to it from this blog post and you can see some of the data. I'll also be working with the data from DL1 this weekend, and getting more videos together from the Dixie Tour."
