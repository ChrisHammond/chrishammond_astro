<p>Last summer I started the HundredPushups.com challenge, I made it two weeks I think before I quit following the program. Tonight I started back up. I am starting from scratch, it is a 6 week program, so my goal is to attempt my 100 pushups the week of Christmas. Though, if for some reason I get delayed or have to redo a week for not meeting goals I will attempt to complete the challenge before the end of the year. That still doesnâ€™t leave me much time!</p>
