excerpt: "Today went a little better than yesterday, weather wise and results wise for myself, though I still wasn't pleased with my performance. I did managed to move in front of Dave today, but could have moved up another spot had I been clean on my fastest run. Lucky for me my 5th run was finally clean, I was fortunate enough to get a red flag on a run, giving me a rerun. Had I not received the rerun i might have made it 4 runs with a cone on each of them, I had a cone on the run I was red flagged so that helped me out greatly. I'll try to get video up and going tomorrow, and I'll work on getting my DL-1 data from the last few events posted on www.racematerials.com"
