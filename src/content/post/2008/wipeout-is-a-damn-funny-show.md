<p>So I'm sitting here in the hotel, reading ramblings over on <a href="https://sccaforums.com">https://sccaforums.com</a>, and watching Wipeout on ABC. I wasn't looking forward to the show as it reminds me of that stupid show on Spike TV with the japanese competitors (which I assume it is modelled after).</p> <p>However, I am almost crying over here, the show is damn funny!</p>
