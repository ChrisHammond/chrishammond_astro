excerpt: "So I'm sitting here in the hotel, reading ramblings over on https://sccaforums.com, and watching Wipeout on ABC. I wasn't looking forward to the show as it reminds me of that stupid show on Spike TV with the japanese competitors (which I assume it is modelled after).   However, I am almost crying over here, the show is damn funny! "
