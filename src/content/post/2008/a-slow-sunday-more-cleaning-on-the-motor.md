<p>So I woke up this morning, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.project240z.com/Home/itemId/399/Little-progress-little-time.aspx">earlier than yesterday</a>, but still not as early as one would have liked. First things first I ran to Radio Shack to get an AC power source for my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chasecam.com/">Chase Cam</a> so that I could use it to record video today.</p> <p>I then started working around the garage, I didn’t shoot too much video today because I wasn’t doing too much interesting when I wasn’t working on the motor. I took the oil pan off to make sure I drained any water from the block due to my impromptu cleaning yesterday. I also put two items on the motor, the thermo stat and one of the inlet/outlets for the coolant. I would have done more but I ran into a problem today.</p> <p>I can’t seem to locate the baggy of all the manifold parts from when I removed the intake/exhaust from the other motor. I found pretty much every other part I could need for the motor except for this bag. I spent much of the day tearing through things trying to locate the bag, I’ll have to keep looking this week to find the missing parts so I can get to the assembly next weekend.</p> <p>Now for the video.</p> <div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:7e113c9b-afd2-4e18-adb1-d41a82e0a4e1" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"> <div id="2f1b4df3-83b6-4a06-908a-158f9875a2e0" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"> <div><a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k480f-hsqgs"><img alt="" galleryimg="no" onload="var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('2f1b4df3-83b6-4a06-908a-158f9875a2e0'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/v/k480f-hsqgs&amp;hl=en\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/v/k480f-hsqgs&amp;hl=en\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;" style="border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none" src="https://www.project240z.com/Portals/0/PublishThumbnails/WindowsLiveWriter/AslowSundaymorecleaningonthemotor_11585/video621876c8e119.jpg" /></a></div> </div> </div>
