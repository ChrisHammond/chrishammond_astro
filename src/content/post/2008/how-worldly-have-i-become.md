excerpt: "So this won’t be a long blog post, it’s late and I’m working on Engage: Publish. But it will be a post nonetheless as I find this funny, and very cool at the same time. In the past hour, I have talked via IM to three different people. Bill Walker, in Canada, Imran in Dubai, and I just finished talking to Stefan in the Netherlands. All three of these people I’ve been talking with I saw face to face within the past 7 weeks, in those countries! (Well, not Canada, I saw Bill in Las Vegas, I’ve yet to make a trip to Canada, but that is definitely a goal for 2009).  I haven’t talked to a single person here in the United States in about two hours when I quit playing XBox 360 (racing against some guys from https://solo2.org).   I have always been one to talk to a lot of people, and keep in touch with people from all over the US as we moved around a lot. We even spent 2 years on Guam and got to tour the Pacific a little bit. DotNetNuke though in the past year has taken me all over the place, I’ve made all sorts of new friends and built stronger relationships with those people I’ve met along the way.   My how DotNetNuke has changed my life! "
