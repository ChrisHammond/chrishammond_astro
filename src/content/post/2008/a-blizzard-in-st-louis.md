excerpt: "So the title of this post might be a little bit of an overstatement, actually it's a HUGE overstatement. We saw maybe 6 inches of snow here. Though that is the largest amount of snow I've seen in Missouri since I've lived here, it is far from a blizzard, but you wouldn't know it based on the news leading up to the storm. I've posted some photos on my Photos page via Flickr."
