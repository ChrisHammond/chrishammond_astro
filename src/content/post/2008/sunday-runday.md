excerpt: "An afternoon trip to the YMCA with my beautiful wife and her sister resulted in the longest distance I've ran/walked since I started this fitness miracle two weeks ago (from today to be exact).  In 40 minutes at the Y I ran/walked 3.4 miles, running roughly 1.83 of those miles, I ended up doing 64 laps in 40 minutes and 15 or so seconds.  After I put a bit more time into my Flickr module I think I'm going to take some time and write a module that will import the XML from my Garmin Forerunner 305 and keep track of my running vs walking time/distance here on the website.  Like my post yesterday said, one project always leads to at least another, if not more. "
