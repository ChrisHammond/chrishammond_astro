excerpt: "I'll be presenting at the St. Louis .Net User Group meeting tonight. If you're in town and have nothing else to do come on out!  www.stlnet.org  I've not been posting many DNN related blog posts here lately, there's a reason for that. I've been trying to seperate my personal site, www.chrishammond.com from some of the technical posts. Right now they are all being posted at https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc and my blog on dotnetnuke.com.  That will all be changing soon though, stay tuned for what I think is a very cool announcement later this week! "
