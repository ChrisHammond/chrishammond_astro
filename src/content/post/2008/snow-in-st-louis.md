excerpt: "So when I got up this morning I was disappointed to find that it hadn't snowed much over night. Lucky for me I stayed home though, by 4pm this afternoon we had 10+ inches on the ground! I spent about 45 minutes outside shoveling the driveway. I didn't do it all, but enough that I think I can get both cars in and out, and made room if the neighbors need to park at the end of the driveway."
