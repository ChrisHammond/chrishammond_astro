<p>I tell you, training sure is draining! For the next two days though I am along for the ride, <a href="https://www.cuongdang.net">Dang</a> is here to do skinning training so I get to take it easy and help out with the students. Friday afternoon I'm flying to Indy to head up to the Peru National tour.</p>
