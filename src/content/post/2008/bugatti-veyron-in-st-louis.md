excerpt: "So it's snowing here in St. Louis today, for STL it's quite a bit, the roads are slick, dusted, with more coming down. What better thing to do at lunch then to drive out to see a 1.6 million dollar car! The local Bentley Dealer had a Bugatti Veyron sitting in the building so Rich, Henry and I headed over to check it out.  I brought the camera with me today as I had hoped to make the treck out there. Here are some of the Veyron photos I took. "
