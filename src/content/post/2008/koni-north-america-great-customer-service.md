<p>Well back in February I had an issue with the <a href="https://www.corvettez06.org/Blog/itemid/63/what-is-it-with-me-and-koni-shocks.aspx">front shocks on the Z06</a>. After two months of me not shipping them off to get fixed I finally shipped them back to Koni last week.</p> <p>Today replacement shocks arrived! I must give out a big thank you to <a href="https://www.koni-na.com/">Koni North America</a> for excellent customer service, even for a customer who is as slow to ship things as myself! Great work, great time dealing with you guys.</p> <p>Now, Nick and I must decide, do we put them on for Atlanta or not? We'll for sure be taking them, and most likely switching them over tomorrow after the practice starts.</p>
