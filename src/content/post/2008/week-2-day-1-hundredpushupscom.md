<p>Today I started Week 2 of the <a href="https://www.HundredPushups.com">www.HundredPushups.com</a> challenge, a day late, but better late then never!</p> <p>Today's challenge, 12-12-9-7-10+</p> <p>I must say, I can feel a difference. I felt great through all my sets, and ended up with 12-12-9-7-20 for a great start to Week 2. I will probably do Day 2 tomorrow and Day 3 on Friday in Milwaukee (heading up there for a race this weekend).</p>
