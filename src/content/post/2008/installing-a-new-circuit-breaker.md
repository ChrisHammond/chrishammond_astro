<p>So the first project to get started on our home automation project is to get a new circuit breaker installed in the basement so that I can hookup the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;offerid=128527.1&amp;type=10&amp;subid=0">SignaLinc Phase Coupler </a><img height="1" alt="icon" width="1" src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;bids=128527.1&amp;type=10&amp;subid=0" />.</p> <p>The Coupler should hopefully help with spreading the X-10 and Insteon love across all of the power in the house, right now I can't get it working on some of the outlets with my limited testing, I believe due to the two phases of electricity in the house.</p> <p>I'll post pictures and updates later today, off to the store now.</p>
