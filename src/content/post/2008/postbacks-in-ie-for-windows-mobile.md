<p>So getting the new AT&amp;T Tilt with touch screen would hopefully resolve my issue with logging into and posting in the forums of a few of my websites that run on .Net software. Unfortunately this didn't get fixed,&#160;I had the same problem on the Tilt as I did on my Blackjack. So I did something I can't believe. I downloaded Opera Mobile. Wow, it works great! And I think I'll even pay the $24 to license it!</p> <p>I can login, post, reply, etc on all my forums now, all from my phone, 3G and Wifi even! Screw you Apple (iphone users), I do it myself, go Microsoft!</p>
