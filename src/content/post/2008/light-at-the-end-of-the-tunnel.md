<p>I'm feeling better this morning. I think I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I've still got a sore throat, though not as bad, and I cough up a lung every hour or so, but I'm definitely feeling better.</p> <p>On a completely unrelated note. I submitted a DNN topic for the Indy CodeCamp a few weeks back. I got an email from them telling me that the topic wasn't accepted. Oh well, their loss!</p>
