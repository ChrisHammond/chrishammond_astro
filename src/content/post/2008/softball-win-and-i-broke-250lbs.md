<p>Tonight we had our first softball game for work. We won! We played in a men's league in 2006 and got slaughtered, lost every game. This year we're in a co-ed league and we pulled out our first win as Engage Software, great times!</p> <p>After the game I came home and showered, I haven't eaten dinner yet, but I went ahead and weighed myself. 249.5 lbs! First time I'm below 250lbs in I don't know how long. I did hit 249 last year, but like I said, that doesn't count because I wasn't keeping any food down that week because I was sick.</p> <p>Now I just need to keep it up. If I hit 235 this summer I'm jumping out of an airplane.</p>
