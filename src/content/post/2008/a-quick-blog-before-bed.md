<p>Well, I've been home 24 hours and already spent a day working, a few hours at the local .Net user group meeting and time working on my new computer. I also got to spend some time with the beautiful wifey, though I am sure she would rather I had spent more time with her!</p> <p>Tomorrow I'll repeat the work part, and hopefully get more time with Natalie.</p>
