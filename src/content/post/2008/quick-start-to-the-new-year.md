<P>Somehow the new year is already here and almost a day has gone by. Happy New Year to everyone!</P> <P>My year gets started quickly, I have to pack tonight as I'm flying to Chicago after work tomorrow night. I'll be back in St. Louis late Friday night. I'm hoping to see the Phipps' new place, not sure if I'll get a chance to meet up with Lindsy while I am up there as well.</P> <P>Perhaps while I'm up there I can get working on our Christmas Cards! I'm shooting for the latest card for everyone this year, so just when you think you won't get any more cards you'll get one from Natalie and I!</P>
