<p>So most of my friends seem to think that running is healthier than inline skating, but I'm not sure the numbers, at least for me, add up to that.</p> <p>I went to Creve Couer Lake tonight and did another workout from the Lakehouse, around the outer loop back to the lake house. I skated for 25:31, with a brief stop to adjust my skate to try and avoid my ankle pain.</p> <p>In that 25:31 I went 4.83 miles, with an average pace of 5:17 min/mil, or 11.4mph, and according to my Forerunner 305 I burned 860 calories.</p> <p>The most calories I've ever burned running were 591, in 41:11, at a pace of 12:38 min/mil and 4.8mph.</p> <p>So, at least for me, skating looks to burn more calories. I think that is because when I skate I push harder, and keep my heart rate up for longer periods of time, versus when I run I walk for a while and my heart rate comes back down. Check out the following two links, on the left under activity dashboard you'll see a heart rate link.</p> <p><a href="https://trail.motionbased.com/trail/activity/5486458">Here's a link to today's workout.</a></p> <p><a href="https://trail.motionbased.com/trail/activity/4968948">A run at Kirkwood Middle School back in February</a></p>
