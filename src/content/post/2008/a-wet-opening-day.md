excerpt: "Today I went downtown, near Busch Stadium. Though I paid $25 to park, I wasn't there to watch the game. I was there for our first DotNetNuke Training class. Everything went great, the feedback from the attendees was good, and I think i successfully filled their heads with all sorts of information.   I did miss opening day, but got to see a lot of the stadium and the crowds. The training facility is literally across the street from the stadium, so we had the blinds open all day and got to take in the crowd while everyone learned. "
