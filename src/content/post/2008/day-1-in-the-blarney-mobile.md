excerpt: "Well, today went well. First runs in the morning I had a decent time on the left side of the course, the right side though I had cones on both runs. With the cones I ended up sitting in second to last place, 9 of 10. This afternoon though I was able to clean up my runs and get myself into 4th place out of 10.   I'm happy with where I am, though I think I can get some more time out of the left side course tomorrow if it isn't raining. If it is raining I figure the results from today will stand.  "
