excerpt: "Imagine my suprise today when I check out the current ProSolo points and find my own name at the top of the list! Granted, I'm the only one of three in SS who has run two events, but still I'm #1!!   I imagine that won't be the case come DC Pro, unless I find my way out to DC and a Codrive in SS, the first part being the easy part.  "
