<p>So I made some minor adjustments to the site tonight. I made the header at the top 62% smaller, taking up less area on the page. I also changed some of the photos around. My good buddy <a href="https://www.chadhobson.com/">Chad Hobson</a> got pulled from the headers for now. He might make an appearance again in the future.</p>
