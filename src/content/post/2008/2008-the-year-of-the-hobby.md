<P>What did I do tonight? More than most nights!</P> <P>I got home and decided it was time to tear into the motor that blew in the 240Z. So I did that! I found the piston. <A class="" href="https://www.project240z.com/Blog/tabid/53/EntryID/104/Default.aspx" mce_href="https://www.project240z.com/Blog/tabid/53/EntryID/104/Default.aspx">Well, I found some of the piston, in 100+ pieces</A>. After working on the car tonight I had dinner with my wife, then came upstairs and was planning on getting some work done. Instead I opened up my Bass case and plugged into the amp. I played for quite a while, far longer than I expected, mostly learning some Green Day tunes. I must admit, I think I was born a base player, not a guitar player.&nbsp;I find it so much easier to just pick up and play a song, though, bass parts are generally easier!</P>
