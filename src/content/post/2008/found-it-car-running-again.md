excerpt: "So I found the problem I was having with the ABS/TCS/Active Handling  That right there used to be two wires, they've been carefully braided together as one.... I went ahead and cut/spliced everything back together, so far the car seems to be fine. I'll order a replacement wire from the dealer Monday morning. I'm also going to try to get another alignment in the morning, I'm not convinced the alignment from Thursday was correct, we'll see how that goes."
