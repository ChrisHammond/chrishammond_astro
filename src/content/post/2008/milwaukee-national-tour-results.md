<p>So the weekend started out wet on Saturday, Sunday started out the same. It was very overcast and foggy/wet on Sunday morning, by the time we ran Sunday morning though it was nearly dry on course, all of the water was out of the air and the sun was out making it hot.</p> <p>After first runs I had a decent time, but I knew that time wouldn't be anywhere near what I needed to run. I was the last driver in super stock, so I had 2 more runs to watch what everyone else did, then a chance to put down my final time. I was able to run what I think was the 5th fastest time of the day in SS, though it was enough to move me up into 4th place, from 5th, by about 24 thousands over another Z06 driven by another Chris. Dave managed to get three clean runs, an impressive feat for him, though he was off of my time by about 8 tenths if I recall correctly.</p> <p>I was happy to finally have a decent Sunday at a National Event, I think it has been 4 National events where I left very disappointed on Sunday afternoon. Moving up a position on Sunday is always a good thing in my mind, though I was 1.9 seconds back from third place after the two day totals. This I believe makes for my 4th National trophy this year, 2 Pro Solo trophies, and two National Tour trophies.</p> <p>Sunday afternoon I helped Jason Hoops (sorry dude can't spell your last name) run the Chase Cam in his car, I had hoped to get the video posted online tonight but with the power flipping out now it will have to wait until tomorrow.</p> <p>I'm off to bed, need to be sure to set my alarm on my phone as some storms are moving through tonight and the power has flashed off 6 times already this evening.</p>
