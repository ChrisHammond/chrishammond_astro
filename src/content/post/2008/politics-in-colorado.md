excerpt: "Another item we will take into consideration when moving to Colorado is the political climate of the various areas we look at. At some point in the future I would like to run for office, I don't know what office, but I am sure it will depend on what we find for the political climate of the various areas. I am sure this will take a little bit of research, and possibly talking to folks within the communities in order to gather the necessary information, but I think this will be an important part of picking out a location for us to settle down. With the upcoming elections I will definitely be keeping an eye on what happens in Colorado, what the various issues of interest are, and how the voting winds up."
