<p><a href="https://www.wpbf.com/news/16758597/detail.html">Check out this story</a> of a crazy lady who lost her dog, didn't go to animal control for two weeks (after someone had already adopted it) and then stole the new owner's cat!</p> <p>Granted, I would be pissed if I lost my dog and someone wouldn't give it back, but this was a little drastic.</p>
