excerpt: "Natalie dragged me to the YMCA this evening. I ran a complete mile, plus 1 lap (1/18th mile laps), then walked for a while. In between walking I believe I ran another 1/2 mile, so tonight was the longest distance I've run since I started. I also went for 40 minutes this evening, up from my usual 30 minutes.  Tomorrow I'll shoot for another 40 minutes and hopefully start doing some other workout things at the Y besides just running.  I didn't get a chance to do anything with my \"software posts\" today, but I will do that this weekend, discussing the conversion steps from CommunityServer to DotNetNuke, and explaining all the software that I'm using on the site now!
