<p>Yesterday I spent an hour or so working on the motor in the garage. I only got one thing finished, and hopefully it is finished and doesn't need to come off again, I got the cover and gasket installed on the head. After that I got the oil cooler connections on the side of the block and then spent some time cleaning up other items on the blog. It's amazing how much crap is on that&#160;block, I wish I had a pressure washer to clean it off.</p> <p>[YouTube:xGsn6qp57xw]</p> <p>&#160;</p>
