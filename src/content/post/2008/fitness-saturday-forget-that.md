<p>I went down to the park today to rollerblade some.</p> <p>I went 1/2 mile then turned around! It was DAMN cold out. 55 degrees apparently, but I swear that 20mph wind made it feel like it was below freezing, and considering I was in a long sleeve t-shirt and shorts it was too darn cold for me!</p>
