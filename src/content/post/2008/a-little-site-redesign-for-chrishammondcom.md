excerpt: "So for the past week I’ve been working on a new skin/layout. It’s not much, but it’s a start of cleaning up my personal site a little. I’m going to be making some tweaks to the formatting of the way the blog posts are displayed over the next couple of weeks. In order to do that though I need to get the 5.3 version of Engage: Publish released so that I can get to work on the templating system for the module that will allow me to do the new formatting that I want.   What do you think of the new look? "
