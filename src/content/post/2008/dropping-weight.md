<p>So I've slowly been dropping weight the past month or so. This morning I hit 250lbs, for the first time in over a year, and really the first legit time in probably 3-4 years. Last year I hit 249 but that was after being sick for 3-4 days.</p> <p>I doubt I'll be under 250 tomorrow morning, I feel like I ate too much today, but hopefully by this time next week I'm a few pounds under 250.</p>
