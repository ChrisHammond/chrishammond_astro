<p>Tonight after work I headed home to grab my skates and go to Creve Couer Park. I skated my normal loop, though not in as fast a time as I have done in the past. It was quite windy, and a bit chilly, which I wasn't expecting, there were also some parts of the trail that were still wet so I had to take it easy on those sections to keep from falling. I wish they made some "wet" inline wheels, perhaps they do? I stopped and adjusted my skate once, and I think I've managed to figure out how to pad my ankle enough to keep my skate from rubbing.</p> <p>I hope to go again tomorrow, but we'll see how that goes, it will depend on the weather.</p>
