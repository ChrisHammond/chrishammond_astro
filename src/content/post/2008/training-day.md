<p>Well here goes my first blog post from the cell phone. Today I am conducting the first class in our second week of classroom <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Products/DotNetNukeTraining/tabid/1299/Default.aspx">DNN training</a>. Up bright and early to the sunrise, though I think that will be the last of the sun seen today based on the thunder I hear now!</p>
