<p>So I was sitting at home today, I had planned to go to the barn to shoot video of some sale horses but Natalie took the truck keys with her by mistake this morning. So I sat down to finish a movie I started yesterday but hadn't finished.</p> <p>After I sat down to get started and had a little lunch the doorbell rang, this is probably the first time the doorbell has been rung in 3 months? Pylon didn't even know what to do. It was someone walking around trying to drum up support for Obama. She was looking for my parents as they were registered here for a short while last year while they were on the road in the RV, I told her they didn't live here any long and then she asked if&#160;I would be voting. To which I replied yes, the next question she asked was "Will you be supporting Obama", in which my reply was "No", then she darted off&#160;the front porch.&#160;</p> <p>Funny stuff.</p>
