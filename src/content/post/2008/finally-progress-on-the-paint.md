excerpt: "So after way too much time spent on this whole deal I believe that this paint fiasco is almost behind us. The word I got today is a check was put in the mail today, so I have Saturday morning (and afternoon and evening) slated for a full detail job on the Corvette.   It will most likely take all day, but the car always loves a good rub down. I think my boss is going to come over and do the same to his Minivan, though I am sure he will give up about half way through the process realizing he's clay barring and waxing a minivan!  "
