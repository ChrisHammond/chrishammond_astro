<p><a href="https://www.domoticsblog.com/DesktopModules/EngagePublish/itemlink.aspx?itemId=20">In the last post I made mention of</a> the fact that I hadn't heard anything from <a target="_blank" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;offerid=128527.10000181&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0"><font color="#000000">SMARTHOME</font></a><img height="1" alt="" width="1" border="0" src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;bids=128527.10000181&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" /> regarding my order which included in the USB version of the Insteon SDK.</p> <p>Well I called <a target="_blank" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;offerid=128527.10000181&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0"><font color="#000000">SMARTHOME</font></a><img height="1" alt="" width="1" border="0" src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;bids=128527.10000181&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" /> yesterday and they told me that they would be unable to fulfill that order because the USB version was not longer producted, so I cancelled the order. Today I called them again and learned that their Serial SDK was still available, though it was listed on the site as backorder.</p> <p>I went ahead and placed my order again, this time for the Serial version of the SDK (2600S). I also ordered the <a target="_blank" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;offerid=128527.1474&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0"><font color="#000000">Hardwired SignaLinc Phase Coupler (Signal Bridge)</font></a><img height="1" alt="" width="1" border="0" src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;bids=128527.1474&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" /> as well as a <a target="_blank" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;offerid=128527.4992&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0"><font color="#000000">INSTEON SwitchLinc Dimmer, White</font></a><img height="1" alt="" width="1" border="0" src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;bids=128527.4992&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" />&#160;again.</p> <p>When checking out I selected "ship items as available" so that one item doesn't hold up the whole order. I checked my Visa card and they charged me for part of the order so I'm going to assume that tomorrow I'll get a shipping notification for at least some of the items!</p> <p>The excitement is building!</p>
