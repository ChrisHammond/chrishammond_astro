excerpt: "So I went to the gate but they aren’t letting us into the walled in area yet. This airport is interesting, there are people everywhere, and most of them are laying on the floor sleeping, why I am not sure.  So I “think” that my flight has power outlets at the seats, at least I hope it does. I would like&#160; to get some work done while on the flight, though, I imagine the first portion of the flight I will be sleeping as we leave at 11:35pm local time.  I’ll try to get online in Atlanta assuming we aren’t late, I have a two hour layover there. "
