excerpt: "So it's Friday. The end of a busy but short week. This weekend, I'm going to automate our house....  Well, I'm going to start at least. I have some controls and software from Smarthome to start working with, along with a paper to write for econ class, and shocks to install on the Corvette.  Sunday I'm hoping to head off to Grafton Illinois to photograph some Bald Eagles. "
