<p>Because I slept for 5 hours after the event yesterday I was up until about 4am this morning, working on video from the autocross. I didn't get all of it processed but I did get quite a few posted. I'll try to get more posted later this week.</p> <p>All the video&#160;posted (except for one inserted video)&#160;was shot with the <a href="https://www.chasecam.com/">Chase Cam</a> and PDR, we are proud to have <a href="https://www.chasecam.com/">Chase Cam</a> as a <a href="https://www.corvettez06.org/Sponsor_Info.aspx">sponsor</a> here at <a href="https://www.corvettez06.org/">CorvetteZ06.org</a></p> <p>You can find them on the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157602395054879/">Corvette flickr set</a>, or by watching the videos below.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <h2>Chris Hammond Run 1 (41.6**)</h2> <p>[FLICKR|2667444458]</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <h2>Chris Hammond Run 2 (the rerun)</h2> <p>[FLICKR|2666625431]</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <h2>ChrisHammond Run 3 (40.7** +1)</h2> <p>[FLICKR|2667451528]</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <h2>Dave Whitworth Run 1</h2> <p>[FLICKR|2666639375]</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <h2>Dave Whitworth&#160;Run 2</h2> <p>[FLICKR|2666643115]</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <h2>Beth Whitworth Run 1</h2> <p>[FLICKR|2667482886]</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>Thanks again to Randy at <a href="https://www.ChaseCam.com">www.ChaseCam.com</a></p>
