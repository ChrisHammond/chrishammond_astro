excerpt: "Tuesday is always a good day. I was born on a Tuesday. I went to the YMCA this evening after work, I ran/walked for 40 minutes, and covered 3.3 miles in about 40 minutes. I think I'm going to have to start extending my exercise a bit more, I started doing 30 minutes, and am up to 40 minutes, perhaps I'll go for 45 minutes tomorrow night.  I also weighed myself while I was at the Y and weighed in at 252.5 lbs! Another pound and a half in the next two days and I'll be down 10lbs for the month (1/14-2/14). So we'll see how that goes.  For lunch today I went to Tropical Smoothie Cafe in Des Peres. I always go there, I easily eat there 3-4 times a week, sometimes more. It's a fairly new place, only been open a few months now, but we love it at the office. I eat a King Ceaser wrap without tomatoes everytime I go, along with a selection of smoothies that I will also have. If you're looking for a smoothie in Des Peres Missouri be sure to check it out! It's right by Trader Joes. I eat there enough I've though of asking Terry, the owner, if he'd like to sponsor a race car. Terry, if you read this, I'm looking for a sponsor! www.corvettez06.org "

There was a cop blocking the exit onto Manchester eastbound, no big deal, I'll go west and get on eastbound further up the road. Wrong, I got to Barrett Station road and realized what was going on. Luckily I got turned around and to the light in a good location to shut the truck off and wait.</p> <p>There was a funeral procession for one of the officers slain in the <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/desktopmodules/engagepublish/itemlink.aspx?itemid=1063">shootings in Kirkwood</a> last week. I wish I had timed it, but I believe I sat there for nearly 30 minutes, and I am fairly certain I saw every police car in a three state area pass by. It was very motivating to see such response for a fallen officer. My heart goes out to the family and friends.</p> <p>After work I headed to sears to pickup an order I had placed this weekend for some supplies for the garage. I'm hoping to work on organizing the garage some more this week as I really need to get the shocks on the Z06 this weekend (race next week in Georgia).</p> <p>Tis getting late and I must head to bed!</p>
