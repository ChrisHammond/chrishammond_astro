<p>So today I spent some time working around the house with my family, my parents visited us for the holidays. After cleaning up the xmas decorations my wife headed off to ride her horses and my dad and I worked on a few things. </p>  <p>I received a few <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;offerid=128527.1&amp;type=10&amp;subid=0">Insteon </a><img height="1" alt="icon" src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;bids=128527.1&amp;type=10&amp;subid=0" width="1" />devices for xmas this year so we worked on getting those wired up in the house. We now have two <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;offerid=128527.1&amp;type=10&amp;subid=0">Smartlinc Insteon Dimmer Switchs </a><img height="1" alt="icon" src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;bids=128527.1&amp;type=10&amp;subid=0" width="1" />hooked up, one in the living room, and one in our bedroom.</p>  <p>My trial license of mControl expired, so I am going to have to figure out what to do about software to control the switches, I still think I would like to write my own, but weâ€™ll see how that goes. I have enough other projects to keep me busy without trying to start up my own open source home automation application.</p>
