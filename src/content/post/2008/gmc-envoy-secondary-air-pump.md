<p><a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/tabid/54/itemid/1142/gmc-envoy-check-engine-light">so last week we took the Envoy in to the dealer to get the check engine light taken care of.</a> They replaced a relay for the secondary air pump, well on Friday the damn check engine light came back on.</p> <p>Today we took it back into the dealer, thankfully they were really cool and fixed it again at their cost. This time they replaced the air pump itself, which I think was the problem to begin with. I'm thinking that we probably got a good deal out of it, assuming replacing the relay was cheaper than replacing the air pump.</p>
