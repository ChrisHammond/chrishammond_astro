<p>I got up this morning with the intention of polishing/waxing the vette. I got started, and that's about all. I found water spots on the car, that I had hoped would come right out, they didn't. So I investigated what might get them out and found a product from maguires that removes water spots, though I tried three parts stores and couldn't find anyone who carried it.</p> <p>Next I tried vinegar, that works on some of the spots, but not all. So the car is now in the garage for a few days. I'll try to polish/wax it in the evenings this week before I leave for DC on Thursday.</p>
