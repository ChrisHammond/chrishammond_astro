excerpt: "A year ago (yesterday actually) I ordered a pair of shoes from Zappos. AT first I really didn’t care for them, I almost sent them back. But now, a year later, I love them! I think they are the best shoes I’ve ever owned, and I’ll be damned if I can find another pair of them! Here they are  https://zeta.zappos.com/product/7323632/color/102737     I need a men’s size 13, if you see them somewhere available, buy a pair, send them my way! There are some look alikes on Zappos but not of the real thing in my size. The difference between the look alikes and these is the gore-tex. The pair I have are waterproof and I love them, please help me find them, please!"
