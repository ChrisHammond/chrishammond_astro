<p>So I finally got around to cleaning up the Corvette yesterday. It really needed a coat of wax and a good going over with the clay bar so after a round of golf in the morning I came home and gave the car some love.</p> <p>Here's the order of things on Sunday.</p> <p>Wash<br /> Claybar<br /> Wash<br /> Polish<br /> Wax<br /> RainX<br /> <br /> I spent 4.5 hours or so cleaning up the car. All the marks are removed from the paint, though there are still some cone marks in the <a href="https://www.ultrashieldstl.com">clear vinyl</a>, the <a href="https://www.ultrashieldstl.com">clear bra</a> did it's job protecting the paint! If I had been smart I would have put wax on the bra prior to the events this year, then I'm pretty sure the marks would have come right out. It now has a coat for future protection!</p> <p>And now for the results</p> <p><span class="photo_container pc_s"><a title="Grassy" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2466033183/"><img class="pc_img" height="75" alt="Grassy" width="75" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2015/2466033183_97284f4105_s.jpg" /></a></span>&#160;<span class="photo_container pc_s"><a title="Crossing" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2466032173/"><img class="pc_img" height="75" alt="Crossing" width="75" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2302/2466032173_a86b22f752_s.jpg" /></a>&#160;</span><span class="photo_container pc_s"><a title="Yes that is me" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2466029893/"><img class="pc_img" height="75" alt="Yes that is me" width="75" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2230/2466029893_ddcabbfe6b_s.jpg" /></a>&#160;</span><span class="photo_container pc_s"><a title="Lonely" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2466856058/"><img class="pc_img" height="75" alt="Lonely" width="75" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2246/2466856058_d857ffea44_s.jpg" /></a></span></p>
