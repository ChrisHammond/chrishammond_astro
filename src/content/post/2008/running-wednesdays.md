<p>So for lunch today we headed to KMS to run some laps around the track. I ran for 33:14 with a distance of 2.65 miles. <a href="https://trail.motionbased.com/trail/activity/4968948#">You can see some of the data in Motionbased</a>.</p> <p>After our run we all headed to Tropical Smoothie Cafe, again :D</p>
