excerpt: "The Fourth Season of LOST started tonight. After LOST was the premier of the new show Eli Stone, during the commercial breaks for Eli Stone there were commercials for Oceanic Air, the airline of the doomed flight on LOST. The URLS in the commercial were flyoceanicair.com and a hidden one find815.com. I&#39;m assuming www.find815.com is out of bandwidth as I can&#39;t get the darn URL to load! Perhaps it will work tomorrow. "
