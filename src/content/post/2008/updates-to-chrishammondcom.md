<p>So I made some more changes to ChrisHammond.com today. I updated the URL structure of the site to use the URL Master module from <a href="https://www.iFinity.com.au">https://www.iFinity.com.au</a>. So far itâ€™s working great. The urls should be shorter and cleaner now, hopefully more SEO friendly as well. Take a look around, if you see anything wrong let me know.</p>  <p>Happy Thanksgiving!!!!</p>
