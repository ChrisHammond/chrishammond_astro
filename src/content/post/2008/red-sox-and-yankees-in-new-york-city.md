<p>It looks like New York in two weeks will be a Family affair! The New England clan will be driving/flying? down to join me at the Red Sox Yankees game on the 26h at Yankees Stadium. I'll repeat the process in Boston a month later as I have a pair of tickets to two games at Fenway in the final regular series of the 2008 season, also against the damn Yankees.</p>
