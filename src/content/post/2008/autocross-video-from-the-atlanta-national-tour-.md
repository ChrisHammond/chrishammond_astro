excerpt: "Since I've acquired new PC hardware, a new laptop and a new desktop, I've been able to finally do some editing of video from races. Though I've only got one run put together. I think the video turned pretty cool. This is one of my runs from the Atlanta National Tour, on Sunday. Â         The Chase Cam video turned out great, I think I'm going to adjust the settings for the G readings this weekend at the Peru National Tour"
