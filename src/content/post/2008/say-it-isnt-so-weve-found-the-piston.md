<p>What? Chris actually worked on the 240Z? Impossible! It tis true, it really is. Tonight&nbsp;I got home and decided it was time to tear into the motor, so I did just that. I even recorded the whole process, so hopefully I'll have video up soon. For now you can check out the photos of what I found, be warned, it's not pretty!</p> <p>Here's the first one, this is NOT ALL of the parts, there are still parts in the motor that may never come out.</p> <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2179836912/"><img height="160" alt="IMG_4695" width="240" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2148/2179836912_26989f9a66_m.jpg" /></a></p> <p>At first I thought I found a nut, and that was the culprit of the whole mess. I don't believe that to be the case, I believe the nuts/bolts connecting the rod to the crankshaft came free, though, perhaps that was the problem, maybe they were lose?</p> <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2179172767/"><img height="160" alt="IMG_4702" width="240" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2373/2179172767_079df13ca4_m.jpg" /></a>&nbsp;</p> <p>I'm going to save this piece, and perhaps attach it to my office door at work.</p> <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2179174735/"><img height="160" alt="C" width="240" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2326/2179174735_c0f9d241f8_m.jpg" /></a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Plenty more pictures in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157594465585463/">Project240Z Set on Flickr</a></p> <p>UPDATE <a href="https://www.project240z.com/tabid/54/itemid/55/In-search-of-a-piston.aspx">here's a link to tonight's video.</a></p>
