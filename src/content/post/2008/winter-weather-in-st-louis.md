<p>Here's a small rant. Why does St. Louis have to FLIP out at the prediction of snow? The forecasters are calling for 4-6 inches, 6 inches folks, that's nothing! There is no reason to flip out that it MIGHT snow!</p> <p>I'm sure everyone will clog the highways tonight trying to get home early before the snow, I'll wait it out. As long as I can get home and run at the YMCA, and then watch LOST, I'll be set.</p> <p>Anyone watch the Season 3 finale last night of LOST? Amazing, I'm totally stoked about LOST again, I was starting to fade because I hadn't watched it in 9 months!</p>
