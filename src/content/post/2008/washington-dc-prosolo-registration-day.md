excerpt: "This morning I got up and went to the Udvar Hazy exhibit of the Smithsonian Air and Space Musuem out in Virginia. It was well worth the trip, I got to see a Space Shuttle, that had to be the coolest part. I took a couple hundred photos, I'm going through some of them this evening and should have them posted on my flickr page later. After that I headed over to Fedex Field to see how the setup for the ProSolo was going. I spotted the Purple Beast (1982 Camaro) that I will be driving on Saturday and Sunday and headed up to introduce myself to Eric, one of the owners of the car, I'm his codriver for the weekend. I walked around a bit and said hello to a few folks and then got some tickets for the practice starts. Eric took a few starts and then I took a couple to see how the car felt. To be honest, it definitely doesn't have the power that the Corvette does (one wouldn't expect that), we will see though, that might not be a bad thing. The clutch is the one thing that I think will take some getting used to, that and not having ABS. The ABS thing will be interesting based on my normal style of slamming on the brakes hard.Â I don't think that will be necessary on this ProSolo course here in DC. More tomorrow."
