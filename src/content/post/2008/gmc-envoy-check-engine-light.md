<p>So the CEL in Natalie's Envoy came on this weekend. We ran to Autozone and had them scan it, error code came up with a message about the air pump, part of the emissions system.</p> <p>We took it to Lou Fusz Pontiac Buick GMC where we purchased it back in November. $220 later and it is fixed. It is rediculous that dealers charge $100 for a computer scan, when Autozone will do the same thing for free.</p> <p>The service guy, Kevin, quoted me an additional $70 above the $100 testing fee, then the cashier told me on the phone it was $50 more. I'll be calling and speaking with Kevin in the morning. I don't mind paying the extra money, but I don't like customer service people lying to me....</p>
