excerpt: "So I just watched the new Knight Rider. I really don't know what the deal with the show is. There was some HORRIBLE CGI in the show, at one point they zoomed out on the car driving down a desert road. As the road got smaller I swear the car stayed the same, to where it was taking up 3/4ths of the road!  The story was alright, though I'm lost. Is this a new show? Or was this a 2 hour movie? It was promod as both, but makes no mention, and I can't find any, about upcoming episodes. "
