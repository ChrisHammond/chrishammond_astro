<p>Well the Peru National Tour is over and I am finally back home. I left St. Louis on the 19th of June and made it home, 10 days later.</p> <p>Sunday of the Peru National Tour was better than Saturday, I finally managed to get a clean run, as did Dave. I think I ran the 5th fastest time in SS today, so I was happy with that. On my third run I ended up blowing out the far turn around, after that I pushed it a little hard in the slolom and paid the price with a little case of the white tornado.</p> <p>I ended up moving up 2 positions for the day, as did Dave who was less than 2 tenths back from me on his best run today.</p> <p>I'll work on getting video up from the event over the next few days. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157605893623417/">You can find 3 videos from yesterday here on this flickr set</a>, as I post more they will also be listed there..</p>
