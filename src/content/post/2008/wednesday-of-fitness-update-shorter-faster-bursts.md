<p>It looks like I forgot to post about my running for Wednesday, now that it is Thursday morning I'm officially a day late for posting the data!</p> <p>Lucky for me my <a class="" mce_href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3XPYQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B000E3XPYQ" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3XPYQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B000E3XPYQ">Garmin Forerunner 305</a>&#160;keeps track of all of that for me so I don't have to worry about forgetting how much I ran!</p> <p>Tonight, according to the Garmin I ran/walked 2.5 miles. Unlike the past two days I did not run a complete mile in on spurt, tonight I ran harder for shorter amounts of time, still running 19 laps (18 laps to a mile at the YMCA).</p> <p>The funny thing about the results from running tonight, the 2.5 measuremant from the Garmin was for 45 laps, which based on 18 laps/mile was also 2.5 miles, I'll have to go back and look at the data and see if the Garmin has become more accurate over the past few days!</p> <p>My heart rate also looks to be lowering the more I run, which I am assuming is a good sign! I haven't hit the 190bpm that I hit on Saturday, in fact I haven't even come close (within 10bpm)&#160;to that heart rate again.</p> <p>When I ran my mile on Tuesday it looks like my BPM never went above 172bpm, while tonight it did go a bit higher, up to 179, but I was also running paces that were 3 minutes per mile faster.</p>
