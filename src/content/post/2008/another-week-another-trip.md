excerpt: "So I am excited about this coming weekend. Thursday morning I am headed to Boston to present at the New England VB User's Group, I'll be helping them to launch a new website running on DotNetNuke as part of the presentation, it should make for a cool show I hope.  After that I have some big plans! Friday for lunch I am going to the BoSox club luncheon, the Red Sox just clinched a playoff spot tonight, so this weekend's series should be all abuzz, especially since we'll be playing the F'n Yankees for the last 3 games of the year! My aunt and I will be going to the game Friday night and Sunday afternoon, I'm sure I'll have pictures up early next week.  It will be a short time back home next week as Natalie and I leave for Amsterdam next Friday the 3rd of October. "
