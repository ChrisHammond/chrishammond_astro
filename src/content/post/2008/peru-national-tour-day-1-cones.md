<p>So the CorvetteZ06.org Team took 9 runs today at the National Tour here in Bunker Hill Indiana. 2 out of those 9 runs were clean, the rest were DNFs and coned runs. Here&#39;s a quick overview of what I can remember</p>  <p>Dave&nbsp;<br /> Run 1 (Cones)<br /> Run 2 (Cones)<br /> Run 3 (DNF Cones)</p>  <p>Chris<br /> Run 1 (DNF Cones)<br /> Run 2 (Cone) fast enough for 5th or 6th if clean <br /> Run 3 (Cones)</p>  <p>Beth<br /> Run 1 (Cones)<br /> Run 2<br /> Run 3</p>  <p>I am sitting in 9th, Dave in 11th, Beth in 3rd in SSL.</p>  <p>I&#39;ve reviewed my video from Run #1, and I don&#39;t see anywhere that I DNF&#39;d the course, I did spin through the finish and hit a cone or two, but it sure doesn&#39;t look like I left the course at anytime.</p>  <p>Right now tomorrow for Dave and I is just for fun, to see how well we can do in the car after a bad Saturday. I&#39;ve got video from all the runs today, though it looks like the audio didn&#39;t record, I will have to check that out in the morning to make sure we get audio of tomorrows runs.</p>
