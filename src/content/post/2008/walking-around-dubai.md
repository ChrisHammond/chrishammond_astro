excerpt: " So I slept in this morning, well morning and afternoon, I was up till around 3am trying to give Natalie a call to make sure she arrived home. I woke up today around 1pm and finally got myself out of bed around 2pm. I took a shower and headed downstairs for the VERY LARGE brunch they have here at the hotel on Fridays.  Following brunch I walked around for about an hour. I must say, so far I am not impressed with Dubai. The area around the hotel is under so much construction, at least where I walked, that everything is dirty. Did I mention the heat yet? I might end up taking a darn shower here before my conference call at 5pm just because I am so hot and sweaty from my walk! Here are some photos I snapped while walking around, notice it is extremely hazy  &#160;       "
