excerpt: "Another weekend, another hobby!!!! Why oh why! I blame one of the owners of Engage Software, Henry Kenuam for the latest fun. We had a small business planning retreat Friday and Saturday. We went off to a cabin near Warrenton Missouri for two days of talking about the business and where we want to go, fishing, drinking, and poker. It was a great weekend, we got a lot done and had a lot of fun to boot. Some of the pictures are uploading right now of the fishing fun. I had a great time, catching 11 or 12 bass in about 3 hours of fishing time. The pictures that are uploading now are just from Saturday before we left, I'll try to get some of the Friday photos off the various cell phones..."
