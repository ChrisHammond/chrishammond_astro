<p>Day 1 here in Milwaukee was wet! Beth ran the car in the first heat on the brand new hoosier wets, by the third heat Dave and I switched to the race rubber.</p> <p>Beth finished up today in 2nd place, if she can stay there tomorrow she'll win a trophy and a free contingency tire! Dave had his usual cone issues, he complained about the car being too loose on corner exit, but I think he just forgot that it was wet outside.</p> <p>I ran well, I'm sitting in 5th after Saturday, .14* back from the 4th and final trophy position. Tomorrow I am going to do my best to try and move up, not back like I have the past few National events on Sunday.</p> <p><strike>I'll have videos posted of our Third runs here in a bit.</strike></p> <p>Update: Videos Included</p> <p><strong>Dave Whitworth Run 3</strong><br /> [FLICKR|2683527651]</p> <p><strong>Beth Whitworth Run 3</strong><br /> [FLICKR|2683498957]</p> <p><strong>Chris Hammond Run 3</strong><br /> [FLICKR|2683513423]</p>
