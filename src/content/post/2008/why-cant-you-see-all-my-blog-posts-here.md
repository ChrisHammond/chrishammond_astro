<p>So I blog in MULTIPLE locations, many different website, but not all the posts make it back here to ChrisHammond.com. Well I hope to fix that over the next few days! I'll be setting up a page to track all my latest blog posts from the various sites. Now, to see if a service like feedblaster will do that for me, or if I need to write a module to do this.</p> <p>Perhaps I'll setup my own blog pinging service?</p>
