excerpt: "So I've been trying to figure out when the HTC Advantage 7510 will be available for purchase, more importantly when it will be available in the US. So far I haven't had much luck, but I did stumble across a site that says 1st Week in April 2008. I don't know if that is accurate or not, that is so far the only date I've been able to locate on any website. The price, at $1200 is a bit higher than I had hoped, I doubt I'll spend that much, but we will see."
