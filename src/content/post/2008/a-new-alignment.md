excerpt: "So I took the Z06 to Sears this morning to get another alignment done on the car. I hadn't had one done since 4/3, which was before most of the races and before I screwed the alignment up putting the Koni shocks back on. The toe in the rear was hosed (unsure why), the camber in the front was off as was the caster on the left front corner, which could explain the damage to the tire in Toledo.  We'll see how well this new alignment works on Sunday as Dave and I battle it out, our goal is to finish 1 and 2 in index at our local event, me in 1st him in 2nd of course!  "
