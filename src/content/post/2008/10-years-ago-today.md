excerpt: "Ten years ago today my dad retired from the Air Force after thirty years, and life as our family knew it changed forever. I loved being a military brat and am extremely proud of the service my father provided to our great country for 30 years. In honor of dad's retirement ceremony 10 years ago I figured I'd post a link to the photos I have from that day. These photos were some of the very first digital photos I ever took. https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157603241213401/"
