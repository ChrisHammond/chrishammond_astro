<p>If you&#39;ll be attending OpenForce in Las Vegas this week be sure to get your RSS Feed added to DNNBlogs. I&#39;ve spent some time this week setting up a separate feed for OpenForce specific blog posts. You can check it out on this URL OpenForce</p>  <p>If your RSS feed is already part of dnnblogs you don't have to do anything except make sure to put OpenForce, Open Force, or Las Vegas in the title or excerpt of your posts, the consumer on the website will do the rest! <strong>This is only for new posts</strong>, I might go back and reassign some of the existing posts to the new RSS feed but no promises on that one.</p>  <p>The goal here is to provide a list of all OpenForce specific blog posts for those who aren't in attendance! If you're also a Flickr user check out the photos in the OpenForce08 Flickr Group I created while I was in Europe at the OF conference there. I will be posting photos throughout the week in Las Vegas, you can do the same by joining the group.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/openforce08/" mce_href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/openforce08/" title="https://www.flickr.com/groups/openforce08/">https://www.flickr.com/groups/openforce08/</a></p>  <p>I look forward to an exciting week in Las Vegas and I hope to meet as many of the attendees as possible, feel free to come up and introduce yourself throughout the week.</p>
