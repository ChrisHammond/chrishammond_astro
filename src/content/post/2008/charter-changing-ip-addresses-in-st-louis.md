<p>For the first time in I believe over a year it looks like I just got a new IP Address from Charter here in St. Louis.</p> <p>I'm not sure why it would change all of a sudden but it is completely different than the IP address I've had for the past year. I lost internet here for about 15 minutes, and when it came back up I noticed everything was different. Luckily I don't host anything out of my house.</p>
