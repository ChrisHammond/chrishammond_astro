<p>Natalie and I haven't gone to a movie in a while (a while for us is a month or so), so we went to see Hancock tonight.</p> <p>I must warn you now, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, if not ever. I like Will Smith, I generally like his movies, but this one, I don't know what the point of the movie was, seriously. I want my 18.50 back!</p>
