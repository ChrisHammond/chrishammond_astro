excerpt: "I'm sitting here in my hotel for the Atlanta National Tour while I should be asleep I'm sitting here blogging. It's pretty warm down here, or at least it was today, much warmer than it was in Washington DC where I was all week. It looks like the weather should be good this weekend, so that will be nice. I doubt I'll have to worry about tire temperatures this time around, as I will be sans codriver for my first event of the year. "
