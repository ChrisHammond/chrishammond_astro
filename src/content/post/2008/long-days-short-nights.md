<p>I love travelling, but I think I need to plan my trips out a bit better.</p> <p>I went from 8:30a to 10pm tonight with two different clients. It's enjoyable to say the least, but I am drained, we also start back up at 7am tomorrow.</p> <p>At 11am I'm off to meet with another client for lunch, then head to the airport to fly back to Atlanta.</p>
