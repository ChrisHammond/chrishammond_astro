So Auntie Carol and I went to the Red Sox Yankees game tonight. It was fun, but we ended up having to leave before the game was over because we feared we would miss the last T leaving the station, which I think we might have actually caught (the last one).

I didn't take my usual photos of the pitches and swinging, as it was raining, and I've learned that most of those shots don't turn out for anything, instead I decided to try and take some cool shots to play with the HDR configuration.

I don't know yet that I was successful as they require a lot of processing, but here's one I quickly played around with this (evening/morning) from just outside the Kenwood Square station.
