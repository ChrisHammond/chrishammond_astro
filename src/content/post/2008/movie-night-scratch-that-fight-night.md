excerpt: "Natalie and I were planning on heading off tonight to see Indiana Jones, but ran into a wall. We both crashed and fell asleep after a long day. I woke up and now am getting caught up on a the Elite XC fight that I set to record tonight on CBS. This is a first for MMA as they have a national audience on network TV. It will be interesting to see what the response is."

<p>Natalie and I were planning on heading off tonight to see Indiana Jones, but ran into a wall. We both crashed and fell asleep after a long day. I woke up and now am getting caught up on a the Elite XC fight that I set to record tonight on CBS. This is a first for MMA as they have a national audience on network TV. It will be interesting to see what the response is.</p> <p>Update: Fight 1 wasn't much to see, the preacher boy got clocke and hit the mat pretty quickly. One thing I'm noticing, I'm watching all of the commercials.... You can tell who this night is aimed at, guys my age, well, maybe guys younger than me.</p> <p>Update: Fight 2 see #1</p> <p>Fight 3, Crush wins! Crush wins! Crush wins! Crush wins! Crush wins!</p> <p>Fight 4, sorry to see it called early due to a poke in the eye.</p> <p>Fight 5, no clue, the darn show ran over 2 hours and I had only set the DVR to record the scheduled 2 hours :(</p>
