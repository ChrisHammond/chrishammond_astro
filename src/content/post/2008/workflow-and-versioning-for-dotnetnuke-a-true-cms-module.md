excerpt: "Earlier today we had a customer post a question in the forums on www.engagemodules.com regarding using Engage: Publish as a replacement for the Text/HTML module within DotNetNuke.  That is definitely one of the use cases we have for Publish, though have not promoted that much. Using Engage: Publish as a replacement for the Text/HTML module gives you actual CMS functionality within DNN. You can now have versioning and approvals on your content for your website, rather than just giving access to content editors who then can make live changes on your website.  For the steps to configure Publish as a Text/HTML replacement check out the Wiki entry I updated today on the topic. "
