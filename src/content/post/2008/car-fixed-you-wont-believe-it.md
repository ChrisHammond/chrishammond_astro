<p>I can't believe this, but I will post this publicly to shame myself for being such an idiot.</p> <p>Step 1 when putting your tires back on the car, be sure that you put the proper tire on the proper end. I had the driver's side tires switched, front on the rear and rear on the front. The passenger side was fine, so with a 17" on one rear and 18" on the other things go haywire......</p> <p>This was an expensive screw up..</p>
