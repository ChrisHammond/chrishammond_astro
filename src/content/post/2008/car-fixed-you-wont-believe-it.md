excerpt: "I can't believe this, but I will post this publicly to shame myself for being such an idiot. Step 1 when putting your tires back on the car, be sure that you put the proper tire on the proper end. I had the driver's side tires switched, front on the rear and rear on the front. The passenger side was fine, so with a 17\" on one rear and 18\" on the other things go haywire...... This was an expensive screw up.."
