<p>I spent the day today cleaning up the Corvette and then setup the new look of the car for the upcoming Solo Nationals. A big thanks to Dave at <a href="https://www.SoloPerformance.com">www.SoloPerformance.com</a>&#160;for getting the vinyl cut yesterday. It took me pretty much all afternoon to get this done, with washing the car, clay barring a few parts of the car, polish and wax, applying the vinyl then another wash.</p> <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2769051041/">I think the car turned out great, you can check out the flickr photos to see what it looks like</a>. Now for the video, music from Steve Ewing (<a href="https://www.steveewingmusic.com">www.steveewingmusic.com</a>)</p> <p>[YouTube:2WknGS2_qOA]</p>
