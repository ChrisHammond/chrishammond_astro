excerpt: "Well, Grafton Illinois sure markets themselves as the winter home for Bald Eagles, but we didn't see any there today! We went up the Great River Road today hunting for Bald Eagles (with a camera, not a gun).  We ended up seeing a couple flying near the Brussell's Ferry though nothing too close. After that quick stop we headed up to Pere Marquette State Park to see what we could find. The kind lady behind the counter at the park told us she got a phonecall that there were a bunch of Eagles at the Winfield Ferry.  So we took off, back to the Brussell's Ferry and then drove across the peninsula to the Winfield Ferry to cross over the Mississippi River back into Missouri. When we got to the Winfield Ferry we weren't sure we were going to see anything but a quick hope out of the car found a couple of Eagles flying above.  After crossing over the Mississippi we took a quick jaunt north towards the lock and dam, which ended up being the most fruitful of our efforts on this bitterly cold Sunday.  We found a pair of Bald Eagles hanging out in the trees near the lock and dam.  I'm going through photos right now and hope to have some of them posted on Flickr later tonight! "
