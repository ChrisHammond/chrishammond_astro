<p>Due to a vendor mixup I'm short a set of wheels this weekend and autox season starts up. I need to buy a 17x9.5" C5 Z06 wheel to complete a set, and I need to do this before Thursday so I can get tires mounted Thursday night and drive to Kansas City Friday morning. <br /> <br /> Any chance anyone local has one wheel? I'd even consider a pair or a full set (2 17s and 2 18s) if someone has them. They don't have to be in good shape, just not beat to hell and back.<br /> <br /> I'd even be down for a set of C6 wheels in C5 Z06 sizes if anyone has them local.</p> <p>UPDATE: I think I figured out a work around to avoid buying another wheel right now. More tomorrow</p>
