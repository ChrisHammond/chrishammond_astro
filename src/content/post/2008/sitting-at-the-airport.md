<p>So I am sitting at the Newark Airport, ready to fly home. Flight is just a little over an hour away. Talk about a long two days, but it was definitely fun. Met some great people training today, hopefully they learned a lot from the session. I'll post another blog tomorrow when I can must up some energy.</p>
