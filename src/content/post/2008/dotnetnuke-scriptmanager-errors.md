<p>Well I believe I have found a fix&#160;for the scriptmanager errors that people have seen randomly on some DotNetNuke websites, and even more so on this site.</p> <p>I'll be posting information about the fix tomorrow but I wanted to get a blog post started for it. As of right now it requires making some changes to the DNN core code and recompiling, but it's not a large amount of code to change, and it will hopefully be included in the next DNN release (after 4.8.1).</p> <p>More on the fixes tomorrow, assuming I don't see any of the errors in my event log in the morning!</p> <p><a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/desktopmodules/engagepublish/itemlink.aspx?itemid=1094">here's a link to the fix!</a></p>
