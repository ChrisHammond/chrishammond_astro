excerpt: "So, late last night I put the OEM wheels/tires from the Tahoe that I had sitting in the garage up on Craigslist. Here's the post I made  \"I have a set of 17\" wheels off a 2005 Tahoe Z71. They are stock wheels and tires, have less than 15k miles on them, and most likely less than 10k (I got them with the Tahoe but it had 20s on it at the time I purchased).  I sold my Tahoe and don't need them taking up any more room in my garage.   4 wheels in great shape, no known scratches, only dusty from sitting around. 4 tires in great shape (see picture for tread) except for 1 tire has a screw in it, I never had it fixed as it held air enough to drive around on for weeks at a time when I used them last winter.   Also have the lug nuts and plastic lug nut covers for them.   \"  I was shocked to find that I got 3 emails within 20 minutes of posting it, at MIDNIGHT on a Monday.   This morning I woke up and had another 8-10 emails sitting in my inbox. Here's the best one I got  \"I'm not an expert in wheels and tires but do you think these wheels could fit a ford contour 2000 model. I really need new wheels and would really appreciate if you look up that for me. Thanks alot \" - from comondi@sbcglobal.net  Comondi, wow, I don't really know what to say? These are 17\" wheels and tires off a 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe, 6 lug, and you want to put them on a 2000 Ford Contour? Really? "
