excerpt: "Well, I saved $1k dollars over what I was thinking about purchasing, though I did take little bit of my economic stimulus check and put it back into the economy today. I finally replaced the phone I've been wanting to replace for a while, I picked up the AT&amp;T Tilt, otherwise known as the HTC TyTN II. I'm heading out of town and figured it would be a good time to get myself a new phone. Now I have a ton of new things to play with!"
