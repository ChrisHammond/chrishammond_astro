<p>Well, I saved $1k dollars over what <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/tabid/54/itemid/1118/htc-advantage-7510">i was thinking about purchasing</a>, though I did take little bit of my economic stimulus check and put it back into the economy today. I finally replaced the phone I've been wanting to replace for a while, I picked up the AT&amp;T Tilt, otherwise known as the <a href="https://www.htc.com/www/product.aspx?id=640">HTC TyTN II</a>. I'm heading out of town and figured it would be a good time to get myself a new phone.</p> <p>Now I have a ton of new things to play with!</p>
