<p>I filled out a form this morning on <nolink href="https://www.junkmycar.com"></nolink>www.junkmycar.com to have the Parts car removed. Hoping that they will call me and schedule it to be picked up on Saturday or Sunday.</p> <p>That means I have a LOT to remove from the car before then. I'm hoping to really get working on removing the interior this evening after work. More updates then!</p>
