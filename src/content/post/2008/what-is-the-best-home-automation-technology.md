<p>So it has been a while since we've done anything with our Domotics (Home Automation) blog, and it's getting to be winter time, time for projects inside the house.</p> <p>Last year we started down the path of Smarthome products, but we didn't proceed all that far into the system. We still have the hardware, and will most likely use that hardware/technology going forward, but first the question is.</p> <p>What is the best Home Automation Technology? There are multiple technologies out there. X-10, Smarthome, Z-Wave, Zigbee, just to name a few.</p> <p>So what do you think is the best technology, and what?</p>
