<p>Great news! Part of the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;offerid=128527.10000181&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" target="_blank"><font color="#000000">SMARTHOME</font></a><img height="1" alt="" src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;bids=128527.10000181&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" width="1" border="0" /> order came in today. The two modules arrived though still no word on the SDK. I'm actually thinking I might not need the SDK and the 2600S as I may have another solution in the works! More on that if I find out more information tomorrow!</p>
