<p>Dave and I spent the day working on the Corvette. Here's what was accomplished</p> <ol>     <li>drain the rear end and replace with Redline gear oil</li>     <li>removed the rear Konis from the car and replace with the stock shocks</li>     <li>drained the transmission and replaced with redline</li>     <li>drained/replace oil and filter, both with Mobil 1</li>     <li>hack the stock radio to add a line in</li>     <li>wash the car, clean off all of Dave's cone marks</li> </ol> <p>#5 and #6&#160;were done by myself, Dave had left by then. #5 involved splicing into the CD input line and wiring up a minijack input, I actually wired this into the back of the radio, I thought it was ingenious, but I figured out the error in my ways. The jack I used was one that when nothing was plugged into it would allow the CD audio to pass through normally. When a line was plugged in the jack input is used and the CD Audio is bypassed. Anyone see the err of my ways?</p> <p>By mounting the jack in the back of the radio I effectively disabled the CD audio from working until the radio is removed and the minijack wire unplugged. This actually isn't a big deal for me, I never use the CD player anyways, and now I can listen to my Zune! Though I will most likely need to rewire or just unplug this before I sell the car, otherwise the next owner won't know WTF is going on.</p> <p>Now it's time for a <a href="https://shirt.woot.com">https://shirt.woot.com</a> party, I'm meeting some guys from the office there. Race on Sunday!</p>
