excerpt: "So I’m sitting here working on Chapter 1 of the book, not getting as much done as I would like, but far more done than I expected to actually get done tonight. I find myself easily distracted, playing with my music, posting on twitter, running downstairs to get a drink, snacking, with a little writing sprinkled in here and there.  Another common distraction I like is to read the headlines and news. I don’t just do this when I’m working on the book, I do it all the time, at work, at home, it’s a habit, I’m not sure it’s a bad habit though?"

<p>So I’m sitting here working on Chapter 1 of <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/archive/2008/10/22/i-m-writing-a-dotnetnuke-book-dotnetnuke-a-user-s-guide.aspx" target="_blank">the book</a>, not getting as much done as I would like, but far more done than I expected to actually get done tonight. I find myself easily distracted, playing with my music, posting on twitter, running downstairs to get a drink, snacking, with a little writing sprinkled in here and there.</p>  <p>Another common distraction I like is to read the headlines and news. I don’t just do this when I’m working on the book, I do it all the time, at work, at home, it’s a habit, I’m not sure it’s a bad habit though? </p>  <p>Anyways, the reason for this blog post, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/12/03/quiz.weekly.news/index.html" target="_blank">CNN has a quiz of 10 questions covering events from the past week</a>, I assume this is something they do often, though I can’t say I’ve ever seen it myself before. In the spirit of procrastination I took the quiz, and I must say I got 10 out of 10! What’s that mean? I read too much news? I am good at guessing? I’m not sure, but honestly I only guessed on two of the questions, one was an easy guess based on what I knew about discussions over the past few years, the other was a more recent political one that I honestly didn’t quite know, but was able to rule out at least one of the answers as being not possible due to having seen other recent headlines.</p>  <p>Take a chance on the quiz yourself, let me know how you do! </p>  <p><a title="https://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/12/03/quiz.weekly.news/index.html" href="https://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/12/03/quiz.weekly.news/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/12/03/quiz.weekly.news/index.html</a></p>  <p>Now, I must get back to the book, though I’m only going to for a few minutes longer, I need to get to bed soon.</p>  <p>(Currently listening to Ben Folds, One Day as A Lion, Kings of Leon and Guns ‘n Roses, all great music I’ve purchased from Zune in the past 3 weeks, alright, I really bought a hard copy of GnR, the rest are Zune purchases though)</p>
