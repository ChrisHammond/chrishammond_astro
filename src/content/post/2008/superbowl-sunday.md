excerpt: "Well it's 12:38AM on Superbowl Sunday. In less than 10 hours I'm supposed to be running a makeshift 5k. Why am I not in bed? I can't sleep! I went to bed around 9pm, I think I slept for 30 minutes, and have been up since then!"

<p>Well it's 12:38AM on Superbowl Sunday. In less than 10 hours I'm supposed to be running a makeshift 5k. Why am I not in bed? I can't sleep! I went to bed around 9pm, I think I slept for 30 minutes, and have been up since then!</p> <p>I figured I may as well get up and get some work done since I can't sleep. I'm upgrading <a href="https://www.domoticsblog.com">DomoticsBlog.com</a> to DotNetNuke 4.8.0</p>
