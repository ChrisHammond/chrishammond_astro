excerpt: "So last week I blogged about starting up a program that I read about on www.hundredpushups.com, tonight was \"Day 1\" for the program, based on the test I did last week I was supposed to start up with the following sets of pushups. 10-10-8-6-7+, the 7+ meaning as many as I could do, but at least 7. The first 4 sets weren't too bad, but I tell you, that last set was difficult! I managed to do 11 on the last take. Day 2 will come on Wednesday, meaning 12-12-10-10-10+ I'm starting to get some normal feelings back in my arms a few hours later, I'm sure about this time tomorrow night I will be very sore!"
