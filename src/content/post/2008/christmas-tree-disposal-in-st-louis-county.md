excerpt: "So I got up this morning and on the way in to work took the Christmas tree to dispose of it. I had looked at the local Fox affiliate’s website and they listed off a location on Adie road in Maryland Heights that took trees, so I went there. Well, what I found was a brick maker, they sure didn’t want my tree :)  From there I headed east on Adie figuring I would just get on Dorsett and head down Lindberg to work, before making it even a block though I noticed that there was another business, St. Louis Composting. Perfect! They took the Christmas tree for $1.   If you’re looking for a place to get rid of your Christmas tree be sure to check them out.   https://www.stlcompost.com"
