excerpt: "I’m sitting at the airport in Dubai, reading to finally hit the road home. Today we had quite the adventure. I’ll see if I get this story all typed up here or not, I am sitting here at the airport without power for the laptop, but I did get on wifi without having to pay anything!  Actually it looks like some people are getting into my gate, so I am going to go try and see if I can’t get through and find a chair with power near it for the 2 hour wait I still have. Perhaps I’ll be back blogging shortly."
