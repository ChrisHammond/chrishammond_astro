<p>Talking with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/clydeorama/" target="_blank">Clyde</a> this week at the Solo Nationals I commented on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/clydeorama/" target="_blank">his photos,</a> asking what it meant when he had &quot;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/clydeorama/2820967216/" target="_blank">3 exposure hdr</a>&quot; on his photograph descriptions on flickr. He told me that meant multiple exposure photos.</p>  <p>So I did a quick google and came across this thread</p>  <p><a href="https://www.dpchallenge.com/forum.php?action=read&amp;FORUM_THREAD_ID=251339">DPC Mentorship - Double Exposure - DPChallenge Forums</a> </p>  <p>Now, I don't know when I will have time to play with this, but this is definitely something I want to play around with!</p>
