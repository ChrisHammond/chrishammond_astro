<p>So Natalie and I are heading to the Denver area for New Years, we’re going to leave St. Louis Tuesday evening the 30th, and stay in the area until sometime on Sunday when we drive back.</p>  <p>I am glad we aren’t planning on flying there! Check out this article about a Continental jet having some major issues trying to leave Denver Airport today!</p>  <p> </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Firefighters found the Boeing 737 on fire, with its wheels sheered off, resting in a ravine about 200 yards from the runway, said Patrick Hynes, chief of the airport division of the Denver Fire Department.</p>    <p>"They described a surreal scene when they pulled up, heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft, all chutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft, people evacuating and walking up the hillside towards them," Hynes said.</p>    <p><a title="https://www.cnn.com/2008/US/12/20/colorado.plane.fire/index.html" href="https://www.cnn.com/2008/US/12/20/colorado.plane.fire/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2008/US/12/20/colorado.plane.fire/index.html</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>I think we’ll drive, thank you very much.</p>
