excerpt: "Carol and I went to the first game of the double header today at Fenway Park in Boston. We had standing room only tickets but with the weather managed to get ourselves seats in the grandstand after the second inning. Another loss for the Red Sox, at least they won the 2nd game of the double header this evening. I'm flying back to St. Louis in the morning, with a 2.5 hour stop in NY. I'm going to try to get to bed now, more tomorrow as Natalie and I prepare for Amsterdam."
