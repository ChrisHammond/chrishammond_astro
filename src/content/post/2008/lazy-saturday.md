<p>Well I got up bright and early this morning to head off with Nick to pick up a 1995 Ford Mustang Cobra. We dropped it off at his house then headed back home. Now I'm sitting here watching TV. No motivation to work on the shocks for the Corvette.</p> <p>I may go out in the garage and do some organizing as it really needs it! I may also head to Creve Couer park and rollerblade for the first time in 2008.</p>
