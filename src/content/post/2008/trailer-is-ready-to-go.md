<p>So I picked up the trailer this evening, here's to hoping the tires have air in them tomorrow so I can bring the car home! Nick is supposed to be here at 9am and we'll head east at that point. I haven't made room for the car in the garage yet, but am hoping that having it at home sitting in the driveway will motivate me to get the garage cleaned up tomorrow. Otherwise the home owner's association will be all over my ass, of that I can guarantee.</p> <p>Pictures and photos tomorrow.</p>
