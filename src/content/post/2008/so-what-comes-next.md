excerpt: "Now that the Corvette is pretty much sold, I will have it for a few more weeks, but John will get it some time after the Solo Nationals, I am trying to figure out what comes next? I was thinking something along the lines of a used BMW barge, maybe a 5 or 7 Series, but Terec reminded me that I have to stick with the Z in whatever I purchase, so if I want a bimmer that pretty much leaves me to a Z3-4 or 8, and I really don&#39;t want a convertible. Here&#39;s how my Z fetish has panned out since 2001. "

<p>Now that the Corvette is pretty much sold, I will have it for a few more weeks, but John will get it some time after the Solo Nationals, I am trying to figure out what comes next?</p>  <p>I was thinking something along the lines of a used BMW barge, maybe a 5 or 7 Series, but Terec reminded me that I have to stick with the Z in whatever I purchase, so if I want a bimmer that pretty much leaves me to a Z3-4 or 8, and I really don&#39;t want a convertible.</p>  <p>Here&#39;s how my Z fetish has panned out since 2001.</p>  <p>1999 Camaro Z-28<br /> 2003 350Z<br /> 1973 240Z<br /> 1978 280Z<br /> 2005 Tahoe Z-71<br /> 2004 Corvette Z06<br /> 2003 350Z<br /> 2004 350Z<br /> 2008 Tahoe Z51</p>  <p>I still have the 240Z, and am not sure what it&#39;s fate will end up being, but what do I do for a daily driver? I would like something nice, comfy, has some power, but doesn&#39;t have to be a race car. What do you think I should do? It doesn&#39;t necessarily have to have a Z in it, but that would be cool too.</p>
