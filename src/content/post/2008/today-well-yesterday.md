excerpt: "Well, I made it to June 16th this year. I managed to blog on at least one of my many blogs every day this year up until June 16th...  Somehow I managed to miss blogging today due to not really being online much. After I finished DNN training today I went over to Sauget to show the trailer to a guy who contacted me on Craigslist. Good news there, I sold the trailer, and purchased a new trailer. But after coming home I failed to get online and blog :(  Though it looks like I blogged on Tuesday just after midnight, I actually hadn't blogged until 11pm, due to the server time being different than the time zone here in the central US.
