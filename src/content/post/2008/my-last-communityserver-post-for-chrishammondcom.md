<P>It is nearly 3pm CST on Wednesday January 23rd, 2008. Almost 2.5 years since I initially setup a .Text blog for this website I am finally ready to convert the site to run on DotNetNuke.</P> <P>I'll post more about "why" I am converting to DotNetNuke, and how I am doing so. </P> <P>Only a few of you will even get to read this via CommunityServer as the conversion will be taking place in just a few minutes.</P> <P>One thing to note if you are subscribed to the site via RSS/ATOM you might have to change your URLs. The new URL will be available shortly.</P> <P>For now, this is it, the final blog post via CommunityServer for the domain name <A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/">www.chrishammond.com</a>!</p> <p mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
