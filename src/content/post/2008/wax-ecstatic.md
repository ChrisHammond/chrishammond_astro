excerpt: "So after providing a day of DotNetNuke Training downtown here in St. Louis I came home and decided to finish up on the car. I used the cleaner wax, then put a coat of polish on, then a coat of yellow wax. I hadn't planned to do all three coats tonight but I really don't have much time in the next week to do this. Thursday I'm flying to Baltimore again, I was just there in the area last month. I'll be doing another week of DNN training for a new client and took the opportunity to fly in early to meet with a client or two, and run the DC ProSolo! I'll be running an ESP Camaro this weekend, it shoud be fun. After the week of training I'm flying to Indianapolis to run the Peru National Tour at Grissom AFB yet again!"
