<p>So I haven't exercised much in the past 2, almost 3 weeks, but this week I started getting prepared for the 100th St. Pat's celebration down in Rolla. <a href="https://stpats.mst.edu/">https://stpats.mst.edu/</a></p> <p>St. Pat's is a big thing down at UMR (MST/MSM) and this year is the 100th anniversary, so everyone has been planning for a big party for quite some time. I booked my hotel reservation almost a year ago, as did quite a few of my fellow fraternity brothers who will be heading down for the festivities. (<a href="https://www.alphadeltazeta.org">www.alphadeltazeta.org</a>) How big is St. Pat's down there? Well they have a parade, and the school is closed the Thursday and Friday of St. Pat's week, and this year they have 311 playing!</p> <p>How have I started prepping? Well unknowingly I started drinking more to get ready! Saturday night, 1 margarita at dinner. Sunday night 1 jack and diet coke. Tonight, 2 jack and diet-cokes, tomorrow? 3!</p> <p>Friday the 14th we're heading down, the 15th is the big celebration, and also my 31st birthday. Sunday we'll recover and drive home.</p>
