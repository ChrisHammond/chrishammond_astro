<p>As some of you may know,&#160;I&#160;have political aspirations sometime in my future. I don't know what, or how far I want to go, but I've always managed to keep myself clean and without skeletons in my closet so that I could ultimately run for office some day.</p> <p>The older I get the more I have this desire. Today I'm sitting here listening to CNN.com's audio feed of the Supreme Court's discussion of the ban on handguns in Washington DC. This is some interesting stuff. I'm a supporter of the Second Amendment and believe that it is everyone's right to own firearms.&#160;Listening to the discussion about the issue at hand is very interesting. I've honestly never listened to such a debate before, it leads me to think: I probably need to take some debate classes if I really want to pursue politics in the near future.</p>
