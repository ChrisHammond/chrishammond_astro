excerpt: "Tonight after work I came home and attempted to salvage this computer. Fortunately I was able to test out the onboard NIC (network card) and disable the gigabit card I have in the computer. With the onboard card things are working like they should be, so I guess I don't have to buy a new computer just yet. "
