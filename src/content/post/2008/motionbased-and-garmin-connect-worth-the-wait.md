<p>So I’ve been a Forerunner 305 owner for almost a year now. I used it heavily in the beginning of the year, and kind of slacked off lately as I haven’t exercised much. I have however been waiting for <a href="https://connect.garmin.com" target="_blank">Garmin Connect</a> to open up to 305 users. If I recall correctly, it was supposed to be done in February of last year, then pushed out a few months, then to September, then December 08, and now they are pushing it out to February 2009.</p>  <p>WTF Garmin. I mean really? I understand software delays, but seriously, do you have a single developer working on this? If so, fire that guy and hire someone else.</p>
