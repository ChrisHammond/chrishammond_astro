<p>It is just a little less than a week now until I will be making my first trek to Europe! I am excited, yet apprehensive at the same time. What will it be like? Will my white american ass be able to cope with being in a strange land? I've only been west before, Costa Rica for our Honeymoon, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong when we lived in Guam, I was 10 at the time, so I don't remember much about being in a foreign land.</p>  <p>Luckily Natalie will be there by my side. She lived in Germany for 2+ years, was born and Switzerland, so hopefully she'll be able turn on her European flair to save me! </p>  <p>The trip to Amsterdam (Noordwijkerhout) may end up being the first week of me being out of the country for two weeks. I hope to get the rest of my trip lined up this week, but I think I might be heading to Dubai in the UAE for a week after Amsterdam. That should be fun too, though I will most likely be going solo on this one, meeting with a client, and hopefully finding time to meet up with a friend from high school in California who I believe works in the UAE for an American company now.</p>  <p>The unfortunate aspect of both trips is that I will end up missing two weeks of school back to back, 3 classes of lecture, as one class is scheduled for a test which I will take this week before we leave for Europe. It's been a busy couple of weeks, 10 days in Kansas, 5 days at home, 5 days (come Monday) here in the Boston area, and then 3 days at home before heading off for potentially two weeks.</p>  <p>I need to catch up on my sleep, though I've slept quite a bit while here in Boston, I've also spent quite a bit of time working and playing, so I am still exhausted. </p>  <p>More on my trips in the coming weeks, I'll be sure to take lots of photos.</p>
