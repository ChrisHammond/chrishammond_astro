<p>What do you think of this as a possible look for the Corvette for Nationals?</p> <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2755260167/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2755260167/</a></p> <p>&#160;<img class="reflect" title="" height="333" alt="Car Mockup by you." width="500"  src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3003/2755260167_a9c4892901.jpg?v=0" /></p> <p>Time to vinyl the car up for Nationals? What do you think? I don't have the luxury sponsors like&#160;James Elterman(<a href="https://www.takatatimeattack.com">www.takatatimeattack.com</a>), I do my own graphic mockups!</p> <p>I also think it would be kinda cool to do the whole back of the car in checkered to fit in with thisâ€¦. (rear facia)</p> <p>Font for #s and CorvetteZ06.org being Impact<br /> RS and SPS would be their usual logos in black<br /> ChaseCam and Race-Technology would be font in black, probably impact to match<br /> The black/white stripes are placeholders for the SCCA required decals.<br /> Hoosier in standard font/black</p> <p>Be honest, what do you think?</p> <p>&#160;</p>
