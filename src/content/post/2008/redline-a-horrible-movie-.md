<p>So sometime last year, I, as most motorheads, heard about Eddie Griffen wrecking a Ferrari Enzo at some driving event. The car was owned by the director of a movie called Redline, a movie that Eddie was in, and this driving event was supposed to be a promotion for.</p> <p>I think Eddie wrecking the car must of been the best promotion this movie ever could have asked for, because the movie itself sucked. The thing only grossed 6 million dollars, after a 4 million dollar opening weekend, that should tell you something. From the IMDB page it looks like the estimated budget was 26 million.</p> <p>This movie was horrible,&#160;I can't believe how bad it was. The quality of the picture was very good, clear, crisp, but the story, racing, lines were just plain idiotic. I can't believe a movie like this was even made.</p>
