<p>Alright, so we aren’t out just yet, but we’re getting ready! Natalie and I fly to Amsterdam tomorrow. I’m excited about my first trip to <a href="https://www.openforce08.com/Home/OpenForceEurope/Overview/tabid/137/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Europe</a>, more on that when we get there! I will probably blog again in the morning, but we’ll.</p>
