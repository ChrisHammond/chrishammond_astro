<p>This post might not last long, but who knows, perhaps it will! This is my first blog post from <a href="https://writer.live.com" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> to ChrisHammond.com. This post is being created on my desktop computer, without using my internet browser. </p>  <p>This might not seem cool to most of you, but the true geeks out there will understand the benefits of this. What else does this mean? Windows Live Writer is interacting with <a href="https://www.engagemodules.com/modules/engagepublish.aspx" target="_blank">Engage: Publish</a>! This is just the first step, and the first real post on the web, but it should be a great improvement for the Publish module as we get the kinks worked out! </p>  <p><strike>Take 2</strike></p>  <p>Take 3</p>
