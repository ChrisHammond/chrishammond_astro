<p>Registration opened up for the 2008 Tirerack Solo Nationals so I jumped and registered as 198 SS for the event. I know I am excited for September to come this year, but I have a lot of work to do before then to be ready. I'm not sure if Natalie will be running Nationals or not this year, we need to see what the horse show schedule looks like.</p>
