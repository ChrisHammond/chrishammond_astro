excerpt: "I'm starting to think that perhaps it's not my skates that are the problem, but possibly my bones? I think I might have a bone spur.  I went to Creve Couer Park tonight to skate after work, it was painful yet again, no matter what I did with my skates it hurt. I went 5 miles, 1 loop around the outer loop and back and forth from the lakehouse to the loop.  Hopefully I can go again tomorrow, though I think I'm going to look into getting a dr's appointment setup to see about my foot. "
