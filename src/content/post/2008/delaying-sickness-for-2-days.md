<p>Somehow I think I managed to push my cold off on Friday, Saturday I wasn't sick from a cold, just from my good buddy Jack Daniels.</p> <p>Today however, I'm feeling the cold. My nose is like a faucet I can't turn off, and my sinuses are plugged to hell. I think this is all because I went almost 10 days without a smoothie from Tropical Smoothie Cafe. I always get&#160;the Vitamin C boost in my smoothie, which I kept saying was keeping me from getting sick. So 10 days without and boom now I'm sick :(</p>
