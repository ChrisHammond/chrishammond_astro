<p>So Greg and I were headed downstairs tonight to meet up with some guys for dinner. We passed <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0369513/" target="_blank">Cole Hauser</a> as we were leaving the elevator in THEHotel, he was heading in, we were heading out. </p>  <p>I recognized him, but Greg yells out, you know who that guy was, and recalls his name off the top of his head.</p>
