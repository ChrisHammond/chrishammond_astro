excerpt: "I spent quite a bit of time today going over the car with the clay bar. I think I hit every square inch of the exterior. I washed it again after the bar and will get up in the morning and give it a once over looking for any paint that I might have missed. Once that is done I will begin the polishing/waxing process, I figure that will take another 3-4 hours tomorrow. "
