<p>So after what I would call a long and painful week I came home this evening and put in some elbow grease time on the F350. I clay bar'd most of the truck, the hood, the sides, and the rear. It got dark so I haven't gone and waxed the truck yet but I hope to do that first thing in the morning, after giving it another quick wash.</p> <p>Then I will wash/clay/wax the Corvette, it's in dire need of a good wax.</p> <p>Hopefully tomorrow before the Derby I can get myself out to a range and do some shooting. I haven't fired a gun in quite a while and I could use the release of some stress right now.</p>
