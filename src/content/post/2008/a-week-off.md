excerpt: "Somehow not running Thursday and Friday of last week has turned into not running for a full week? Hopefully I'll be able to motivate myself to go to the gym tomorrow night after loading the car on the trailer. Doubtful though, so I'll be sure to make myself take my shoes and Forerunner to Georgia with me so I can run while I'm in a warm climate!"
