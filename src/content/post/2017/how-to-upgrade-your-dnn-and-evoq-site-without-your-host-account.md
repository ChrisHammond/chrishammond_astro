<p>With all the security updates and issues with the best CMS for .NET lately, you should have performed a few version upgrades in recent weeks. If you haven't, shame on you, get to it!</p>  <p>One thing that you may run into with an upgrade for DotNetNuke is that you need to know your HOST or another SUPERUSER account in order to complete the upgrade.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/portals/0/publishthumbnails/open-live-writer/how-to-upgrade-your-dnn-and-evoq-site-wi_12e1f/image_2.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="275" src="https://www.chrishammond.com/Portals/0/PublishThumbnails/Open-Live-Writer/How-to-upgrade-your-DNN-and-Evoq-site-wi_12E1F/image_thumb.png" style="display: inline; background-image: none;" title="image" width="455" /></a></p>  <p>Or do you?</p>  <p>Nope! You don't! To upgrade the site (assuming you've already copied all the files out into the proper locations, and you made your backups) you can simply change the URL from</p>  <p>https://www.committo.fit/Install/UpgradeWizard.asp</p>  <p>to</p>  <p>https://www.committo.fit/Install/Install.aspx</p>  <p>Hit enter to load that new URL and watch the upgrade complete!</p>  <p><a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/Portals/0/PublishThumbnails/Open-Live-Writer/How-to-upgrade-your-DNN-and-Evoq-site-wi_12E1F/image_4.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="336" src="https://www.chrishammond.com/Portals/0/PublishThumbnails/Open-Live-Writer/How-to-upgrade-your-DNN-and-Evoq-site-wi_12E1F/image_thumb_1.png" style="display: inline; background-image: none;" title="image" width="403" /></a></p>  <p>You'll see the &ldquo;old&rdquo; DNN upgrade screen, but it works just as well as the newer process which requires a superuser account to complete.</p>
