<p>A few weeks ago we picked up a Google Home device from Best Buy. I must admit, I was always jealous of those of you who had Amazon’s Echo, but we held off on buying a device, waiting for Google to come out with something.</p>  <p>I must say, I am glad I waited! If you don’t have a device yet, definitely consider Google Home over Echo, I think it is even cheaper right now too with the holiday prices somewhere around $99.</p>  <p>Here are a couple of great things you can ask your Google Home for the holidays. Everything assumes you are starting out with “Okay Google” as that is what you need to say to get it going.<br />  </p>
