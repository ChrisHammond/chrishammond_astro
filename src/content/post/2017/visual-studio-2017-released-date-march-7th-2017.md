excerpt: "Mary Jo Foley&nbsp;is reporting that Visual Studio 2017 will release on March 7th, 2017. I guess I better get to updating my DNN Extension Templates for Visual Studio&nbsp;before that release hits! Head on over to https://launch.visualstudio.com&nbsp;for details on some virtual launch events.  What are you looking forward to most with Visual Studio 2017?&nbsp; I'm hoping for faster installation times than it takes to install your operating system!"
