excerpt: "I ran into a problem this evening with Visual Studio 2017 hanging when opening my Solution that I'm working on for my DNNTemplates VSIX project. It would open up solution explorer, it would also open up the TABS in visual studio, but it wouldn’t complete the process and would hang on “Opening the files”.Basically every time I opened the solution, no matter what I tried, rebooting, deleting the .SUO file, deleting the .USER files, nothing would seem to work. I would let Visual Studio site for hours, and it would never complete the opening process.Finally I went in and deleted the contents of the .VS folder, after deleting this contents the solution can successfully be opened. So if you run into problems with “Opening the files”, try deleting the contents of the .vs folder in your solution directory, hopefully that will help you.If anyone from the Visual Studio team wants to reach out to me on this, I have perfview files and files collected from collect.exe as I was trying to troubleshoot the issue."
