excerpt: "Has anyone been able to successfully configure the Insteon Wireless IP Cameras to work with the&nbsp;Insteon Hub, though the Android application?  I've tried multiple times over the past two months and finally gave up and emailed support to see if they can help. My cameras work fine using the IP Camera Tool, but I cannot get the App to finish the &ldquo;Saving settings&nbsp;&ndash; do not unplug camera.&rdquo; screen. It will reboot the camera after applying the settings, but never responds after that. You can then retry, but the camera doesn't reboot a second time.  I've tried with both the camera plugged in to ethernet, and with it just using WiFi without any luck.  &nbsp; "
