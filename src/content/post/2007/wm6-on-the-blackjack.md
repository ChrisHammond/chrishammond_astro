<P>A few days ago I swear I saw a rumor that Windows Mobile 6 was coming for the Samsung Blackjack on November 5th. Well it's the 5th and so far I can't seem to find anything.</P> <P>Even if it does become available today I have to decide if I want to mess with WM6 at all this week or not. Being out of town I'd hate to brick my phone while being in Vegas!</P>
