<P>I spent the last two days taking it easy on my abused body. Yesterday we went into town and did some walking around Main Street. I then spent most of the evening working on the Engage: Publish and Wiki modules for DotNetNuke. Today I stayed home all day and worked on some much needed modifications to the Wiki module, I had hoped to get it ready for another beta today but I wasn't able to get everything done that I needed.</P> <P>We were supposed to get a few big storms in the past two days. The storm for Wednesday didn't amount to much, though the one this evening was quite a storm. We'll see how much snow it actually deposited on the mountain as we head off to Park City Mountain Resort again tomorrow. Hopefully it will have dropped at least a few inches over there, <A class="" href="https://parkcity.typepad.com/park_city_mountain_resort/2007/12/jupiter-rumblin.html" mce_href="https://parkcity.typepad.com/park_city_mountain_resort/2007/12/jupiter-rumblin.html">perhaps they will even update their blog mentioning the results</A>!</P> <P>More pictures and such tomorrow, perhaps even video if I can get the damn GoProVideo camera working.</P>
