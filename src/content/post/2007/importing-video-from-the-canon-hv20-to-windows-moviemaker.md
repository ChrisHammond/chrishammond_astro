<p>If you recently purchased a Canon HV20 you might be a bit surprised when you go to try and use any of the High Definition video you recorded with it. Canon didn't bother to include software on the CD to actually use the video you record. You might try hooking up your camera to your Windows XP machine via Firewire but that won't get you very far either. All I was able to do was to get it to the point where it would transfer DV, which wasn't acceptable to me so I didn't even bother to see if it would work.</p> <p>Instead I installed Windows Vista Ultimate on my desktop tonight. I installed my old Firewire card, hooked up the HV20 to the machine and I had Moviemaker importing video in no time, in HD even! I will let it import tonight and see what all I can do with the video in the morning. I have a tape with about an hour's worth of content on it, some of it for <a href="https://www.project240z.com">www.project240z.com</a> so I hope to get that posted online tomorrow. </p> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
