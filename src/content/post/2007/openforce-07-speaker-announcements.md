excerpt: "A day or so ago Joe posted a link to the speaker announcements for the OpenForce 07 conference in Vegas in November. There are some very cool topics that will be covered out in Vegas. I hope to meet as many of you as possible, and see you in my presentation as well! Here's a link to the OpenForce page. Here's a list from the current Speaker's page. GENERAL  DGN100:&nbsp;DotNetNuke Open Force ’07 Keynote AddressShaun&nbsp;Walker DGN103:&nbsp;Panel Discussion: DotNetNuke – The Road AheadJoe&nbsp;BrinkmanNik&nbsp;KalyaniScott&nbsp;WillhiteShaun&nbsp;WalkerIn this panel discussion, the four co-founders of DotNetNuke Corporation will share their vision for the company and the DotNetNuke Open Source project. The resources, approach and business model required to manage and grow a large Open Source project such as DotNetNuke are substantially different than those required for a commercial software company. Get an inside look at how DotNetNuke Corp. is addressing today’s challenges while preparing for the future.  DGN102:&nbsp;The Quiet Enterprise Web Revolution: DotNetNuke as a WeaponMark&nbsp;TrenchardEnterprises are grappling with ways to reduce system complexity and cost yet increase capability, speed to market, and flexibility. Current web technologies give enterprises the rare opportunity to get it all and the ones that get it are quietly reinvesting in web architectures to achieve competitive advantage. In this session, Mark looks at DotNetNuke from an IT leader’s chair and believes that the solution has a strong value proposition for companies that want to build out a multi-portal platform with a rich set of shared services.&nbsp; He will discuss the DotNetNuke advantages from an IT leadership view and explore the dimensions that are unique to larger enterprises that may need additional investment. SKIN DESIGN  DSD201:&nbsp;Creating Accessible DotNetNuke Skins Using CSSLee&nbsp;SykesCathal&nbsp;ConnollyIn this session you will learn how to create a clean, simple, search engine-friendly and accessible skin that takes advantage of the features that CSS layout designs provide: accessible, flexible, search-engine-friendly, small file size, and cross-browser compatible. You will also become familiar with issues that need to be considered when creating skins that meet accessibility legislation and are XHTML compliant. We will take a freely available XHTML- &amp; CSS-based skin, convert it to a DotNetNuke skin, and configure it to ensure that it renders compliant markup. In addition, we'll look at transforming non-compliant portions of markup, and look at techniques to ensure that your site remains compliant.  DSD101:&nbsp;Introduction to DotNetNuke SkinningTracy&nbsp;WittenkellerThis session will give you a better idea of how to create great-looking and flexible skins for DotNetNuke that utilize CSS. First we will review how to create properly formatted and flexible HTML and CSS for DotNetNuke skins and containers. Then we will take a closer look at XML attributes and the important role they play in defining skin and container functionality. The session will also touch upon customizing the default DotNetNuke menu and its CSS styles. Finally, we will review the proper process for packaging DotNetNuke skins and containers.  DSD202:&nbsp;Menu Controls for DotNetNuke SkinsPeter&nbsp;SchotmanIn this session we will compare and review various free and commercial menu controls for DotNetNuke skins. We will use a range of examples to understand best practices, advantages and drawbacks of the various menu controls.&nbsp; This is a session for the intermediate to experienced skinner who wants to expand her/his toolbox. MODULE DEVELOPMENT  DMD303:&nbsp;Advanced DotNetNuke Module Development ConceptsCharles&nbsp;NurseThis session will focus on some advanced module development topics, including: module skinning/templating techniques, DAL+ and database agnostic tips, module plug-in architecture, use of the property editor and other..."
