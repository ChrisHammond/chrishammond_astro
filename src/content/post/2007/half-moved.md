Natalie and I are half moved. The good half I guess. Most of her stuff, and some of my toys, the office, computers, and TV. Hope to have the rest of the stuff moved over this weekend with the assistance of a moving company from here in town. The new place is nice, though needs some work! Nothing major, I'm going to run some ethernet cables tomorrow night so that I can setup a server in the basement, and have the XBox, computers, Tivo, etc wired up to the network as well.
