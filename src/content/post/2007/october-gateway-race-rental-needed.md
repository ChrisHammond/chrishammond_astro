excerpt: "I'm aiming to do my second race in October, looking for a nice safe/sure finisher, rental for a single race, (not likely both days). I need to finish another race so settle up my novice permit and get my regional license, would like to get it out of the way before my Novice permit goes up next March. Anyone local to STL got any interesting cars to rent? It actually doesn't need to be fast, I'm just looking to complete a race, and I promise to try my best not to do what I did to Jude's car! Though any damage I will obviously pay for..... I'm looking long ahead of time so I can start budgeting everything out before then. posted from..."
