<p>The seats I ordered earlier this week came in today! They look awesome, though they are now in the basement still in the shipping box. I'm not about to put them near the car right now, not until I get the grinding/welding done so I don't cover them in dust/rust and crap!</p> <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/484539295/"><img height="240" alt="" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/484539295_3710b54632_m.jpg" width="180" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
