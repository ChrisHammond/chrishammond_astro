excerpt: "The Tahoe was a great truck. It was a great price, had all the comfort one could ask for, heated seats for those of us getting older with back pains. But it just couldn't cut it on an Autocross course, so the Tahoe was replaced today, but a car much smaller, lighter,&nbsp;faster, and much brighter than the Tahoe. Say hello to my Little Red Corvette  More pictures at my new domain name www.corvettez06.org  More photos coming..."
