<p>Eric and I got a bit done today. Mostly learning with the help of Andy Whittle who stopped by to assist with some Megasquirt questions. I also did some soldering on the Megasquirt wiring, LOTS more soldering to do tomorrow!</p> <p>The fuel cell is mounted, Eric started on the oil cooler mounting, we ended up figuring out that I did have the correct peices for that, so all that money isn't wasted.</p> <p>Sunday tasks</p> <p>Connect Fuel Lines<br /> Run Megasquirt Wires, Fuses, Relays<br /> Install Megasquirt<br /> Install Fuse Panel<br /> Install Battery (charge battery)<br /> Install Seats<br /> Install Radiator<br /> Connect Starter<br /> Connect Alternator<br /> Add Oil to the Motor and Transmission<br /> Add Coolant<br /> I'm sure I'll have to add more to this list.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
