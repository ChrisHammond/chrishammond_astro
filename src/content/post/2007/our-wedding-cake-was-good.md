<P>Well, a year after the wedding I actually got to eat a peice of our wedding cake! It was great! Thanks to Natalie's parents for storing it for the past year. They kept it frozen for us and overnighted it last week. We took it out of the freezer on Saturday and left it in the fridge, then took it out of the fridge to finish thawing on Sunday morning. Last night after we got home from seeing a movie we cut ourselves a slice. I'll admit, we were scared after hearing horror stories from our friends and even my own mother how wedding cake is horrible after a year.</P> <P>We cut a tiny peice just to see, and it was good! Wasn't too dry, wasn't flavorless, it was actually enjoyable. So we cut off a bit more and each had some. I think we're going to eat some more this week, Natalie cut 1/3rd of it and put it back in the freezer to save for another wedding anniversary.</P> <P>I love you Natalie, it's been an amazing first year of marriage, the first of many many more!</P>
