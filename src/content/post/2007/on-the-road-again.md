Heading to Austin. I hate flying Southwest but I guess it is getting a little better, they now have line numbers, more than just A B C, so I'm A 34 meaning I should be somewhere near the 34th person on the plane without having to camp out in the A line to get a spot. No camera with me, so I doubt I'll get any good pictures of Austin!
