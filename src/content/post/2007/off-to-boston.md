<P>Natalie and I are taking our first trip out of town together (after the honeymoon) as a married couple. We're headed to Boston tomorrow, until Wednesday. The main reason for the trip is Opening Day at Fenway, to watch the Red Sox beat the Seattle Mariners! We'll also be doing some touristy things, things I haven't done in Boston in probably 20 years, and things Natalie has never seen. </P> <P>Photos coming next week!</P>
