<p>This just in, there may still be life in the Project240z.... It might get saved from the grasps of Ebay and become just a toy/project/wrench on me when you can car. Not a daily driver, not a race car, just something to play with, work on, add to, without worry of &quot;will it make it faster or slower&quot;</p> <p>More information coming sometime, who knows when!</p> <p><a href="https://www.project240z.com/ToDoList/tabid/85/Default.aspx">Edit: I've created a ToDo list</a></p>
