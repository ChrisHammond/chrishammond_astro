<p>Well, tomorrow night I'm hitting the road. Actually a buddy of mine Kevin and I are renting Harleys for Friday night/Saturday. We'll be heading out tomorrow afternoon towards Chester on IL-3, coming back up the MO after a seafood buffet stop down there.</p> <p>Saturday morning we're going to meet up again and cruise up the riverroad to who knows where. If you've got a bike and want to join us, let me know.</p> <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/502524301/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/502524301/</a></p> <p><img class="reflect" height="375" alt="" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/227/502524301_8b8ae8932b.jpg?v=0" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially();" /></p>
