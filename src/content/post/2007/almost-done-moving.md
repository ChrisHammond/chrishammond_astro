<P>We thought we got everything out of the house tonight, but realized we left a BBQ Grill and large dog cage on the back porch of the old house. So, we'll head back there tomorrow and get those last few items.</P> <P>I'm really ready to be done moving, and I know my back is ready for that as well!</P> <P>The garage is now full, with the 78 280z, car parts, appliances, bookshelves, etc. I hope to get it all organized this coming weekend so I can start tearing into the 78 and get rid of that car as soon as I can so I can bring home the 73 240Z that's in storage right now. Check out <A href="https://www.project240z.com">www.project240z.com</A> for information on my project car(s).</P> <P>Â </P>
