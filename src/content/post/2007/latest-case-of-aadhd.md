<p>So my latest case of Automotive ADHD has me thinking it&#39;s time to get rid of the Tahoe and get myself a CTS-V.</p>  <h3>Pros and Cons?</h3>  <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><strong>Better Gas Mileage:</strong> The CTS-V offers improved fuel efficiency compared to the Tahoe, which can save on gas costs over time.</li>  <li><strong>Smaller Size:</strong> The smaller footprint of the CTS-V makes it easier to maneuver and park, especially in urban settings.</li>  <li><strong>Faster:</strong> With a high-performance engine, the CTS-V provides a thrilling driving experience with exceptional acceleration and handling.</li>  <li><strong>Luxury and Style:</strong> The CTS-V boasts a sleek design and luxurious interior, making it a stylish choice for any car enthusiast.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><strong>Less Room:</strong> The CTS-V has a more compact interior and less cargo space compared to the spacious Tahoe, which might be a drawback for those needing extra room.</li>  <li><strong>Can&#39;t Tow:</strong> While the CTS-V isn&#39;t designed for towing, this isn&#39;t a major issue since the wife has an F350 for towing needs.</li> </ul>
