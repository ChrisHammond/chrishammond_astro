Currently there are a bunch of jobs from Robert Half listed, not to sound too cynical, but I hope it turns out to be something other than just a place for recruiting companies to post their billions of available positions. Personally, I'd much rather see single jobs available from individual companies, rather than recruiters looking to fill a million bland positions. I'm not looking, I love my work at <A class="" href="https://www.engagesoftware.com/" mce_href="https://www.engagesoftware.com">Engage Software</A>, but it is interesting to see who is hiring for cool positions and to see what DotNetNuke jobs are available.</P> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
