excerpt: "After a few months of development we are proud to announce the release of Engage: Publish 4.3 (version #4.3.6 to be exact)  We've been working on Publish for the past few months squashing bugs and adding some very cool new features including improved administration interfaces, new display options, better performance and many more! For a list of the release notes from this version check out this page. You can also check out Engage: Publish's feature list by visiting this link. Current owners of Publish (that are still within 1 year of their original date of purchase) can download the new release from our Engage: Publish page at www.engagemodules.com. You can also purchase a copy of Engage: Publish from our site. A few quick notes:  The AjaxControlToolkit requirement has been moved up to 10618, instead of 10301 as with previous version of Publish.  Publish will not currently run on DNN 4.6.0 due to a breaking change in 4.6.0 that we've discovered. If you have a requirement that Publish functions in 4.6.0 immediately please let us know, we can recompile a compatible version easily.  The 4.3 Version of Publish is only available on EngageModules.com this week, in a week or two we'll have it posted on SnowCovered and the DotNetNuke Marketplace. If you have any issues with 4.3 please post them here in the EngageModules.com Publish Forum. Posted from..."
