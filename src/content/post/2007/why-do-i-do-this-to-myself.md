<P>Why do I torture myself so? Seriously? All day, well since around noon, all I can think about is buying a Pontiac Solstice to autocross. There's a silver Z0k (sport suspension) package available in Iowa, 485 miles from my house. Seriously why do I do this? I have car in the garage, and a Tahoe in the driveway, but all I can think about tonight is getting a Solstice, getting some wheels and tires and competing in it at every autocross I can make it to.....</P> <P>Hopefully this feeling passes tomorrow</P>
