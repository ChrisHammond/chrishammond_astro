<P>Well I'll be on the road in just over 8 hours. I still have to finish packing! I'm meeting a few guys for breakfast at 7am and then we're hitting I70 and heading west towards Topeka.</P> <P>I hope to get there between 12 and 1 so I can get checked into my hotel and then head to Heartland Park to get my paddock spot and tires mounted on the Solstice. Sunday Joyce Ruth and I are driving the Solstice at the warmup, on Monday the Collins should arrive from Massachusetts. </P> <P>Pictures and High Def video will be coming all next week! Stay tuned.</P> <P>Here's the first pick for the week of Solo Nationals, the truck and trailer loaded up tonight!</P> <P><A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1420937552/"><IMG height=180 alt="Ready to roll" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1423/1420937552_2ffbe92a8a_m.jpg" width=240></A>&nbsp;</P> posted from <a href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</a>
