<P>Well, I had tried to sell my extra Wii on Craigslist last week but the guy I promised it to hasn't contact me by the deadline I told him. His loss might just be your gain! Checkout the Wii I have for sale, you can find it on Ebay!</P> <P><A href="https://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=150191131987">https://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=150191131987</A></P> <P>If I find more I'll definitely put them up on Ebay as well!
