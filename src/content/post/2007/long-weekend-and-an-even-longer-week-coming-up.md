excerpt: "Well Friday night I picked up the Vette, so far it&#39;s great! You can see pictures of it over on www.corvettez06.org. Don&#39;t ask me how I got that domain, I&#39;m not sure, somehow it expired in August and no one else had picked it up, I purchased it Friday morning for $6.99! Saturday I spent the day driving the Z06 out in the rain, yes, I know, I&#39;d probably get kicked out of a Corvette club for driving it in the rain, but lucky me, I&#39;m not in a club! It was probably also good throttle modulation practice. I took the car over to Andy&#39;s, and took his wife for the requesit new car ride (she got a ride in the 350Z before Andy as well). Then I picked up good ole NJack (my new name for Nick Jackson) and we cruised around St. Charles for a while. From there I ran down to South County and took Russ for a ride, over to his brother Matt&#39;s and showed off the car there as well. On the way home from Russ&#39; I stopped by the carwash and gave her a quick spray down. Sunday morning I got up and hand bathed the car. I put two coats of wax on, Rain-X, and then headed out to Natalie&#39;s show. On the way to the show I took some pics, and then on the way home I stopped again and tried to get some cool shots as the sun was going down. I&#39;ve decided, I really need to take a photography class, I take a billion photos, and 99.9% of them suck! Now, for the rest of the week. Monday night I&#39;m speaking at the St. Louis DotNetNuke User&#39;s Group meeting. Thursday night we (9 of us from Engage Software) are headed to the Tulsa Tech Fest in Tulsa Oklahoma. I&#39;ll be giving three presentations in Tulsa, and leading a roundtable question/answer session for DotNetNuke topics as well! More on the presentations later this week, if I find time between writing... "
