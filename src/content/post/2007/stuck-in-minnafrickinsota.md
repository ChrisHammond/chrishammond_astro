<P>We're sitting at the airport, we should have taken off an hour and a half ago. Our original flight is now scheduled for 6:07. We moved up to a flight scheduled for 4:50, but by the time we walked the 2 miles to the other gate it switched to 5:30. Actually, it switched from 4:50 to 5:30 in the 10 seconds it took me to sit down, take off my jacket and turn around to look at the screen again.</P> <P>It's pretty amazing watching the snowplows here at the airport race down the runway, talk about a lot of snow going everywhere. Natalie has some pictures but they won't get uploaded till we get home as my silly laptop won't read the 4gb card I gave her this week.</P> <P>Hopefully we'll fly back home tonight, though we may not get our bags until tomorrow due to the flight change. Our new flight is a DC-9 rather than a Canadair regional, so hopefully that will help us get out of here.</P> <P>Update: Now the flight is scheduled to depart at 6:30pm.</P>
