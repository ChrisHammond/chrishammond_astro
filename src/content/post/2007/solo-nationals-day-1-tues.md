<P>Today was an interesting day. It started out dark, cold and wet, finished up bright sunny and almost hot.</P> <P>It rained last night a bit, so the course was wet this morning when we were walking first thing.</P> <P>I ran in CS today, the 5th car or so out in the 2nd heat on the West course. It started drizzling just as I was getting ready.</P> <P>Every run I took was a different surface, the rain came, went, came and went, multiple times throughout the heat.</P> <P>I ended up sitting in 9th, there are 7 trophy positions so I've got some work to do tomorrow! I took a LOT of video today, I'll try to get it posted next week when I get back in town.</P> posted from <a href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</a>
