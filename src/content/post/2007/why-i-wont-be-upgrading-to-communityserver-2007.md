excerpt: "I&#39;m really starting to lose enthusiasm for Community Server the more and more it becomes restricted and pricey&nbsp;with it&#39;s licensing model. I guess it&#39;s time to look into writing some conversion scripts from CS to DotNetNuke for Forums and Blogs, as DotNetNuke still remains a good free solution for community websites. CS seems to become more restrictive everytime the have a new release (once a year).I use CS on a few sites (https://themadblogger.org, https://stlouisinside.com, https://sccaforums.com, https://solo2.org/, https://chrishammond.com)&nbsp;but will seriously consider making the move to DotNetNuke based sites for those currently running CS if the Licensing stays the way it is for 2007. I had actually looked forward to doing the upgrade to 2007 for some of the sites. Open Source works -&gt; www.dotnetnuke.com Posted from... "
