<p>This past week has been pretty darn busy, actually, so far 2007 has been pretty darn busy. At work we&#39;ve been cranking away on a pretty large project built upon DotNetNuke. It&#39;s like nothing I&#39;ve seen done successfully with DNN before, so it&#39;ll be interesting to see when this latest version goes public how well it does. It&#39;s rewarding, but a damn lot of work lately. I can&#39;t wait for February. I keep telling myself in February I&#39;m going to start working on my car again, <a href="https://www.project240z.com/">www.project240z.com</a></p> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
