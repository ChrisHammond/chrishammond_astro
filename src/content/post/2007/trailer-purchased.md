<p>Well I went out and got myself a&nbsp; trailer today, pics tomorrow. I didn't get anything else done on the car, though I did get the drill press put together today. Then we spent the day cleaning the house for a small party we had tonight some old school chums.</p> <p>More tomorrow, pics and video.</p>
