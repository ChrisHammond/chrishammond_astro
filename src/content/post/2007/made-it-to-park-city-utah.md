excerpt: "Well we made it to Park City this afternoon. No issues, weather out of St. Louis was good, we got to the airport in plenty of time. Our flight was on time, though the 8:45 Minneapolis flight I believe left after we did, ours was scheduled for 10am.  I'm pretty sure I've never been that far north in the US except for on the east coast, so the flight out of MSP to Salt Lake City was nice, though I'm not sure where exactly we flew over. I slept most of both flights, had to make up for the 3.5 hours of sleep last night! Philip and Sandra picked us up at the airport and brought us up into Park City. The condo is beautiful, so is the town itself. We ran over to Park City Resort and picked up our gear for tomorrow. Looks like I'll be the only one snowboarding! Hopefully I'll be typing a blog post tomorrow night, still with all my bones intact. Checkout some of the St. Louis snow photos over on..."
