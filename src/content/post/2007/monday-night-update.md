<P>After heading to class this evening I headed off to Sears to pickup a few things for the garage. I picked up a shop vac to assist in cleaning out the interior of the car, and all the rust I plan to clean out of the floorboard. I also picked up a nice portable Vice to go on my new workbench I picked up tonight.</P> <P>I was going to post a link to each of the items I purchased tonight, <a href="https://themadblogger.org/blogs/themadblogger/archive/2007/04/03/Stupid-web-site-developers_2C00_-sears.com-sucks.aspx">but I ran into an issue with Sears.com. I must tell you, Sears.com sucks</a>!</P>
