excerpt: "I'm happy to announce that I've been selected to speak at the OpenForce07 DotNetNuke conference in Las Vegas during this year's fall DevConnections. DevConnections looks to be one of the larger conferences this year now that the PDC has been cancelled for this year. I'll be presenting on \"Portal Administration Best Practices\".  I look forward to sharing what I've learned over the last 4+ years working with DNN in corporate and noncorporate environments, I've worked on some of the largest DNN implementations out there and hope to be able to share some of my experiences with those projects. Being selected to present at the first DotNetNuke conference is a great honor. I know quite a few other guys from my company (www.engagesoftware.com) will be in attendance as well. My wife will also be coming out to Vegas, as OpenForce 07 is the 5th though the 8th of November, and her birthday is on the 4th, she'd kill me if I left her home. I've already got plans to rent a Harley out there for a day with another Core Team Member, and may setup a few rounds of golf while out there as well. On a sad note, I had also hoped to make it to the SDC in the Netherlands in September, but received notification this morning that I wasn't accepted as a speaker for that conference. I guess that means I can spend time in September prepping for the SCCA Solo Nationals, assuming I have my car built by then. See you all in Vegas! Stay tuned for more OpenForce 07 info as I have..."
