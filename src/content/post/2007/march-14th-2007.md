<p>It&#39;s amazing what being sick will do to your weight. Monday night I started to not feel so well. Pretty much all Monday Night/Tuesday morning I was running to the bathroom, multiple times per hour. That sure will wreck a person&#39;s sleep. By Tuesday morning I&#39;ve thrown up twice, and thought I was starting to feel better. I go to take a shower and start to feel worse and worse. </p><p>I went to the DR around 11:30 and did get some good news. From the last visit to the doctor I had dropped a lot of weight, and my blood pressure was down to normal again too. Last visit, in February 2006 I weighed in a 291lbs and my blood pressure was somewhere around 144/96. Yesterday I weighted 255lbs and my blood pressure was 120/80.</p><p>The doc said I most likely just had&nbsp;a virus that was going around, so he gave me some medicine to help with the nausia and told me to take it easy and drink lots of fluids. Natalie and I then went to Walgreens to fill my meds, and pickup some bananas and other things we thought I could eat and keep down. After that I pretty much just went to sleep. I slept all afternoon, and most of the evening, finally signing onto the computer for the first time around 9pm.</p><p>I went to bed last night still feeling pretty crappy, cramps, body aches, but I hadn&#39;t thrown up since 8am. This morning when I woke up I felt much better, and have been able to make it to work and get some things done for a change!</p><p>My weight on Monday morning was 259lbs. Yesterday I had made it down to 249.5 lbs at one point when I had absolutely nothing in me. This morning I weighed 251.5lbs, after being able to eat a sandwich last night.</p><img src="https://65lbs.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=49" width="1" height="1">
