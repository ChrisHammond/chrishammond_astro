<P mce_keep="true">I've started working on a quick application to export Photos from a CommunityServer website. If there's any interest I'll post up the code for this later in the week. I'm working to get <A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/">https://www.chrishammond.com</a> off of CommunityServer and setup on DotNetNuke. Considering I'm a DNN Core team member and my fulltime job is dealing with DNN every day it was about time to do so.</P> <P mce_keep="true">So what will I be using in DotNetNuke to replace the functionality that CommunityServer offers? Here's a list of functionality and my planned replacement</P> <P mce_keep="true">Photos: <A class="" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond" target=_blank mce_href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond">Flickr</A>, I've been using Flickr for over a year now and you just can't beat the service they provide. $20/year and unlimited uploads/downloads, I've got over 10k photos uploaded to Flickr since I started using it, and with this export tool I'll have a few&nbsp;thousand more.</P> <P mce_keep="true">Blogs: Frankly, the DNN Blog is alright, but not great. So I'm working to configure the <A class="" href="https://www.engagemodules.com/Modules/EngagePublish/tabid/61/Default.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="https://www.engagemodules.com/Modules/EngagePublish/tabid/61/Default.aspx">Engage: Publish</A> module I&nbsp;work on nearly every day to provide blog functionality. It's one of the pricier modules you'll find out there, but that's because it has seen 3 years of development and is supported by a company with 14 employees. Adding this functionality will require the following: Tags, MetaBlogAPI Support, better URL handling</P> <P mce_keep="true">There are a few large things I need to work on. 1) Importing my Blog posts/tags from CS into the <A class="" href="https://www.engagemodules.com/Modules/EngagePublish/tabid/61/Default.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="https://www.engagemodules.com/Modules/EngagePublish/tabid/61/Default.aspx">Engage: Publish</A>&nbsp;module. 2) Friendly URL modifications to allow lookup and 301 redirections&nbsp;for the old URLs to find the new URLs within Publish. My goal is to have most of the above ready for testing after the Holiday Weekend.</P> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
