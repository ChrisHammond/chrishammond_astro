<p>So the headline is a little early, but we all know the inevitable will happen. I've always been a Bonds hater, I don't like the guy, don't think he should get the opportunity to break the record.</p> <p>But I've also come to accept that it will happen, and I'm going to try to be there! I've got two Standing Room tickets to the game on Sunday. I don't plan on using them, there's a race on Sunday. But if by chance Barry Bonds hits 2-3 homers Friday and Saturday that will put him within reach of Hank Aaron's record on Sunday, and for that I'll miss, or leave early, the race.</p> <p>Â </p>
