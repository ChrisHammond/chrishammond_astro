<P>The trip to Topeka went great today. I'm tired, it's late! So here's a quick review</P> <P>Met for breakfast around 7am. Hit the road around 8am, stopped three times, got to the hotel around 1:30pm. A quick word about ValuePlace hotels, weird, but cheap, and clean</P> <P>Headed to Heartland Park, parked the trailer, unloaded the car. Got tires mounted from the great Ron Vermulm.</P> <P>Got the car teched, loaded the car into the trailer, locked up and headed back to the hotel.</P> <P>Played in the Poker tournament, lost. Went to Walmart to Stock up on supplies. Got back to the hotel and realized I didn't bring my phone charger, great.</P> <P>So if anyone has a automotive phone charger for a Blackjack can I borrow it for a few hours on Sunday?</P> <P>Tomorrow: Register for the warmup, get the car cleaned up, run the warm up. Take lots of pics and video.</P> <P>Time for bed, a quick pick from today. Lots more pictures tomorrow, and video.</P> <P><A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1425474977/"><IMG height=180 alt=Tech src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1321/1425474977_b5260e693c_m.jpg" width=240></A>&nbsp;</P> <P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P> posted from <a href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</a>
