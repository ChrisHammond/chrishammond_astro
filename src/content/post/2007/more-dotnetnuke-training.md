<p mce_keep="true">Well, I was going to do a quick post about my trip, though I can't say who I was training I did have a good time up here in Chicago!</p> <p mce_keep="true">It looks like my post may be quicker than expected as my battery is about to die sitting here in the airport. Rather than hunt for an outlet I think I'll read my new Dale Brown book for a while, and of course listen to my Zune! More on my trip tomorrow when I get back to St. Louis and the office.</p> <p>Here is more information about our DotNetNuke Training services.</p>
