<p>Sometime last month I reinstalled Windows Vista. I put Vista on my machine (after removing it for XP in early spring) because I wanted to be able to edit HD video in Windows Movie Maker.</p> <p>Shortly after I reinstalled Vista IE7 began to hang whenever it would load. MSN Messenger would also hang up. I think, but am not positive, this was all related to installed Real Player. I hate Real Player, with a passion, but I had a special requirement that I needed to install it for.</p> <p>Because IE7 quit working I started using FireFox, which worked alright, but I'm a Microsoft kinda guy, so I had to figure out how to get my IE7 and Messenger working again.</p> <p>After a few minutes of digging around a found a page for Troubleshooting IE7 on Windows Vista, from there I found a blurb/link about resetting IE7. I clicked on the link, and low and behold, I tried what it instructed, and boom IE7 works again! Now, time to reinstall Live Messenger and see if that works again too!</p> <p>I also think it'll fix my Zune Marketplace issues I've been having ever since IE7 died.</p> <p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/" target="_blank">Here's a link to the KB article I used to fix IE7 on Windows Vista</a></p> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
