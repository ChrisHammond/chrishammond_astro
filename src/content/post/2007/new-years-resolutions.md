<p>So, i've never really officially made a new years resolution before, <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/tabid/54/itemid/406/happy-new-year">well not one I stuck with</a>, so for 2007 I'm making 3.</p> <p>1. Lose weight, ala <a href="https://www.65lbs.com/">www.65lbs.com</a></p> <p>2. Change my spending habits</p> <p>3. Do good in school!</p> <p>The first is pretty self explanatory, I eat too much, don't exercise enough, changing both of those, follow the status of my diet online at <a href="https://www.65lbs.com/">www.65lbs.com</a></p> <p>The second, for those of you who knows me, I always have toys. When I want something, I buy it, and I don't buy the cheapest of something, I buy the best. So, for 2007 I'm hoping to change that. I'm going to attempt to curtail my spending, pay off any bills I have, and start saving money. Natalie's going to help me do this. <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/tabid/54/itemid/691/Dumpster-diving-2007.aspx">See my first blog post from 2007 to show you how I've changed</a>!</p> <p>The third, I'm taking classes again at UMSL <a href="https://www.umsl.edu/">www.umsl.edu</a>, I start up two weeks from tomorrow. For once I need to do well in school (college, high school was easy). I've got 30 credits of economics left to get a BS in Econ, so that's my goal. I won't finish it this year, but I hope to get at least 6 classes down, leaving my only four for 2008.</p> <p>Wish me luck!</p>
