<P mce_keep="true">I'll readily admit, I've seen tons of Resharper posts over the years reading weblogs.asp.net, but i've honestly never payed attention to them.</P> <P mce_keep="true">Last night <A class="" href="https://weblogs.asp.net/scottcate/" mce_href="/scottcate/">Scott Cate</A> was here in town giving a presentation to the local&nbsp;.Net user group and he was using Resharper, I must say I was thoroughly impressed with what I saw of the tool. Before I step out and try to talk the boss into a few licenses for the office, I'm looking for some more input. So tell me, what are your thoughts on Resharper? Likes? Dislikes? What does it help you to do better in your every day coding tasks?</P> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
