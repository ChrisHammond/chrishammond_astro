excerpt: "Today I went to Lynch Hummer here in Chesterfield, MO and test drove a black 2004 Corvette Z06. I forgot how much fun those cars are, last year I drove Krekeler's car at our last Autocross event of the season. You can see some of those runs in the videos below. I got to meet Jim Lynch, the owner, and a fellow SCCA Member. He's headed off to the Runoffs this week in Topeka, Good Luck Jim! Anyways, the Corvette I drove at Lynch just didn't quite fit me, black is a hard color to keep clean, and that kind of made me not want to buy the car they had on the lot. So I've been looking around, seeing what I can find online. I've looked ALL over! I think I've found a few options, but we'll see, heck, I might even end up in a blue commemerative edition car just like Krek's was. Road trip this weekend? Perhaps, we'll see..... my first run [YouTube:tXzCG7dC6j8] my only clean run [YouTube:g7ET3Zm827c] a compilation of the fun [YouTube:A6IrbQa6seA] posted from..."
