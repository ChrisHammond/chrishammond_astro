<P mce_keep="true">So I know I did this back in November without issues, but in February I reinstalled XP and got away from Vista. </P> <P mce_keep="true">Last week I went back to Vista in order to get better support for my new Canon HV20 camcorder.</P> <P mce_keep="true">I installed Visual Studio 2k5 the other day, and immediately tried to install SP1. I've been unable to get SP1 to install. It never actually errors out, it loads the screen that says "extracting" in the title bar, and says it may take a few minutes to a few hours to install. I've let it run multiple times for 12 hours, and this time around it's been running 24 hours, with no change in status.</P> <P mce_keep="true">Anyone have any ideas? I guess i'm about ready to uninstall VS and start over if I can't figure out anything else.</P> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
