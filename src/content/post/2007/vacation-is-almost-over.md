We made it to the Salt Lake City airport. Our vacation is just about over. We had a grea time here in Utah, Natalie was on the slopes 4 days, I was up there for 3. The last day was amazing because there was 10+ inches of new snow so I got to experience my first snowboarding in powder! I got stuck. It was a blast though, I can't wait to go again, hopefully very soon. More when we get back into town.
