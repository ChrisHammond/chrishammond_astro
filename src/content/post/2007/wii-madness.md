<P>So I was fortunate enough to locate myself a Wii on Black Friday. I actually lucked out and found one on Amazon.com at 2am, so I purchased it. I have friends who I thought would want it. Well it ends up most of them have already decided not to get one, so instead of going to Ebay I put it up on Craigslist.</P> <P>I think I have received well over 30 responses to the ad! I wish I had 30 of them to sell, though, if I did then I would have to start dealing with taxes and all that so it's probably better that I only have one!</P>
