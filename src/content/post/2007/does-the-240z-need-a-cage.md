<p>Since I've decided to change classes, and not bother with most of the interior items, should I go ahead and put a cage in the car? I'll be going to XP, which I don't believe requires a cage, but I'd also like to do some time trials/hpde in the car.</p> <p>Any of the St. Louis cage builders want to work out a deal on a cage in exchange for advertising/promotion on Solo2.org/SCCAForums.com/Project240z.com/ChrisHammond.com/Etc????</p>
