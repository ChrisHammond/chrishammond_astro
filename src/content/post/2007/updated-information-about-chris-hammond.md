I updated my "<A class="" href="https://www.chrishammond.com/blogs/about" mce_href="/blogs/about.aspx">about chris hammond</A>" page a bit this morning. I looked at it and realized it hadn't been updated in over a year! I still need to add more information to it, but it's better than it was a few minutes ago, more accurate now.
