excerpt: "So, I'm very fortunate this year for the Solo nationals, Bud Collins asked me to be his tire warmer in his 2007 Pontiac Solstice, something I am very thrilled to do.  I've already told my wife, that if, by some fluke of luck, I were to win CS at the 2007 Solo Nationals in Bud's Solstice I'm going to buy myself a Solstice. I don't expect to win CS, hell I'll be glad to get my first Nationals trophy if I can perform well enough.&nbsp;I would love to have a Solstice to autocross every event, but at the same time I don't want one for my daily driver, and right now i can't justify having a daily driver with a car payment, and an autocross car with a car payment. Now, if I were to win CS at Nationals, I'd get rid of the daily driver and suck it up and drive a convertible around without air conditioning (Solstice Z0k) I made mention of this goal/reward to my good buddy Jeff Krekeler from Krekeler Jewelers in Farmington Missouri today on instant messenger. He proceeded to tell me that I owed him a new monitor to replace the one he was sitting in front of because of the soda I caused him to hurl out of his mouth and nose. Then, and this is the best part, he told me \"you win nationals i'll buy you a solstice\". So, now I need to get myself some cash, bribe all the CS competitors into letting me win the class and claim my car! Granted that bribery probably won't work, but I'll be doing my damndest to see if I can't perform well in Topeka next week. Thanks Krek, you're the best! And this just in, right before I go to submit this blog post, my good friend Dave Whitworth from Solo Performance Specialties has said that he'll split the Solstice with Jeff if I win! posted from..."
