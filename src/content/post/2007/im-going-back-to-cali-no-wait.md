I've been to Washington a few times, most recently last June for the ProSolo event, but I didn't get to do any tourist type stuff, Natalie took all the photos in the link. So I'm hoping to at least walk around for a few hours Tuesday evening taking some cool photos. I've never been to New York, so I'm hoping to get to do some of the major things while I'm there. See the Empire State Building, which I think is a block over from my hotel, as well as visit the site of the World Trade Center, as well as any number of other things I can think of, and hopefully fit in during my alloted time! I'll be back in town on Friday, feverishly working on the 280Z so I can get rid of it this weekend and pick up the 240 from Illinois to get it back home in the garage.
