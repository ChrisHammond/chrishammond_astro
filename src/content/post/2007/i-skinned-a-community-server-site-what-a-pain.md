<p>I&#39;ve <a href="https://sccaforums.com/" title="SCCAForums.com " target="_blank">skinned</a>, or tweaked a CommunityServer site before, but what I must admin, it&#39;s definitely not an easy process, and not something I&#39;d want anyone to have to go through! </p><p>I just skinned <a href="https://solo2.org/" title="Solo2.org The Ultimate Autocross Web Site" target="_blank">Solo2.org The Ultimate Autocross Web Site</a> tonight to get change the design. Skinning within CS has to be one of the biggest pain in the rear things to do. I&#39;ve skinned many a <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" title="DotNetNuke" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> site, and though the Solpart Menu can be rather tricky, no skinning project&nbsp;with DNN has ever been as hard as it was just to make some simple changes to CommunityServer to make <a href="https://solo2.org" title="Solo2.org The Ultimate Autocross Web Site" target="_blank">Solo2.org</a> look like it does now. I realize Telligent says they&#39;ve made skinning easier with their new release for 2007 (everyone and their mother has blogged about it over the past 4 days, twice) but I can&#39;t imagine skinning getting much easier than the skinning engine that DotNetNuke has implemented.</p><p>&quot;Here here&quot; to the guys (core team)&nbsp;who developed that engine nearly three years ago now!</p><p>I&#39;ve still got a lot of work left to do with s2o, but at least it&#39;s not the plain jane site it used to be a few hours ago. Oh yeah, I actually started working on this skin for CS back in October, I quit working on it after 2-3 tries, until tonight when I crunched through the rest of it.</p><p>Take a look at the site, let me know what you think.</p><p>*disclaimer: I may be a little biased towards DotNetNuke, being my position within the DNN Team, but I do use CommunityServer on two of my largest websites, <a href="https://sccaforums.com/">https://sccaforums.com/</a> and <a href="https://solo2.org/">https://solo2.org/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
