Well we have power at both houses now. We took a few loads over to the new place last night, including out bed, and stayed there last night. Tonight we'll do a few more loads. We're trying to line up some movers to get the rest of the big items on Saturday, we hope to have all the smaller items done before then. Cable guy comes tomorrow morning!
