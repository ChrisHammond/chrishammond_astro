<p>So here we are, it's 2021 already and you've hopefully started autocrossing again. We have had the car out to <s>one</s> two events so far.</p>  <p>The first event was back on April 11th, a few days before we started writing this post (and are just now getting around to finishing). Tom S is codriving with me at most events this year, not sure how many out of town events he will be at, or heck how many out of town events I will be at.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.autocrossblog.com/2021-events-1-and-2">Read more at AutocrossBlog.com</a></p>
