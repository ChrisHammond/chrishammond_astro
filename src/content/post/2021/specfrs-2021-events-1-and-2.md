excerpt: "So here we are, it's 2021 already and you've hopefully started autocrossing again. We have had the car out to one two events so far.  The first event was back on April 11th, a few days before we started writing this post (and are just now getting around to finishing). Tom S is codriving with me at most events this year, not sure how many out of town events he will be at, or heck how many out of town events I will be at. "
