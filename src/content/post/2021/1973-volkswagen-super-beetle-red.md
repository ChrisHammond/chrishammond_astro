<p>Before the car was blue (painted in the summer of 1998 in Sedalia, Missouri), it was red.</p>  <p>It was a deep red, with a little sparkle to it. The car came this color when we acquired it in 1993(94?) in Fairfield, California. I honestly don&#39;t recall what the original color of the car was, likely a red or orange, but not the deep sparkly red it is in these photos.</p>  <p>I am still looking for this car if you happen to see it, let me know!
