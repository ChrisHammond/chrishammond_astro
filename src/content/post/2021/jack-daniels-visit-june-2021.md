excerpt: "This week I got out on my first work trip, since probably August 2019. I started a new job last year, about a week after the world shut down for the pandemic, so work trips have been on hold for quite some time, that and the last employer stopped my travelling, so I hadn't been on the road for work in quite some time. It was great to get out and meet some fellow employees and customers face to face. Fortunately for me the trip was to Franklin, TN, which isn't too far from Lynchburg, so I turned the work trip into a little fun too. Before heading down, I signed up for the Angel's Share tour on Thursday morning. Wednesday after the work meetings were over I drove around Franklin TN a bit and did some whiskey hunting, checking out the local liquor stores to see what I could find. I ended up picking up a bottle of Wheeler's Raid, which is a local whiskey out of Nolensville, TN I believe, on the recommendation of a coworker. "
