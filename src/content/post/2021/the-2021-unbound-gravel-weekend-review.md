<p>Two Years ago I was in Emporia Kansas for the Dirty Kanza, riding 100 miles on gravel for the first time. It wasn&#39;t easy, I was slow, and spent most of the second half helping a buddy get through the ride while he was having some serious cramping. Overall we had a great weekend of riding and I made it a point to try to get back. Last year things didn&#39;t go as planned, and I sure as heck wasn&#39;t trained and ready for a 200 mile bike ride if the event had occurred, but I was planning on 2021 being the year I rode 200 miles. Earlier this year I failed to start training/riding early, and ultimately spent about 2 months dealing with some heart issues that I wasn&#39;t planning on having to endure until much later in life.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/unbound-gravel-2021">Read More at www.bicycletips.com</a>
