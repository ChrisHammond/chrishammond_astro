I have yet to get it up on the scales, but I assume going into this that the car is heaver than both of them. The power, heated, leather seats that came with the car, along with the potential extra stereo equipment, and electronics for the VDC mean the car likely weighs a good bit heaver than the previous cars.</p>  <p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Project350z/~4/eMs-woBbZkg" width="1" /></p>
