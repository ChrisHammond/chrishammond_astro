I've debated for the past few weeks if I was going to set any goals for 2014. I'm didn't really complete many of my goals for 2013, but I have decided that I should at least set a few simple goals to work towards.   Last year I rode 822 miles on the bicycle, far less than the 1800 miles the year before. For 2014 I want to ride 2000 miles by bicycle. That'll require that I ride a lot more than I did in 2013. Tomorrow it is supposed to snow, I'm thinking it might be a good time to take the mountain bike out for a spin! To be honest, that'll just be around the yard to see how dangerous riding is in the snow, but before the end of January I need to have at least 50 miles under my belt. <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/36">Read More at www.bicycletips.com</a>
