excerpt: "My website was due for an overhauled design, somehow a full year came and went and I hadn't done any major updates to the website. I guess that is what happens when you, move, change jobs, and have a second child in on year, time sort of magically goes away. A couple of weeks ago I started working on a new DNN skin, to replace my&nbsp;MultiFunction skin&nbsp;that I've had in use here on ChrisHammond.com for a number of years now. Initially I was going to work on upgrading MF, but after giving it some thought, I felt like I wanted to start over, and this time around I wasn't sure that I was going to create an open source skin, most likely just something that I would use for my own websites, of which I have plenty to spread the skin around on."

<p>My website was due for an overhauled design, somehow a full year came and went and I hadn't done any major updates to the website. I guess that is what happens when you, move, change jobs, and have a second child in on year, time sort of magically goes away.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago I started working on a new DNN skin, to replace my <a href="https://multifunction.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">MultiFunction skin</a> that I've had in use here on ChrisHammond.com for a number of years now. Initially I was going to work on upgrading MF, but after giving it some thought, I felt like I wanted to start over, and this time around I wasn't sure that I was going to create an open source skin, most likely just something that I would use for my own websites, of which I have plenty to spread the skin around on.</p> <p>For this skin, which I am calling <a href="www.christoc.com/Projects/HammerFlex" target="_blank">HammerFlex</a>, I went with BootStrap 3 (<a href="https://www.getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">https://www.getbootstrap.com</a>), and Cerulean theme from Bootswatch (<a href="https://bootswatch.com/cerulean/">https://bootswatch.com/cerulean/</a>). In MultiFunction I used OrangeBox3 for the lightbox for photos, this time around I wanted to use something that fit in with BootStrap so I used the Bootstap-Image-Gallery (<a href="https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery">https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery</a>).</p> <p>To get the Carousel on the homepage I used the Carousel plugin within BootStrap (<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel">https://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel</a>)</p> <p>So what all does this mean? The website had a new look and feel, and if you were to view the website on a mobile device, the layout of the page will differ to fit the form factor of your mobile device.</p> <p>All this with only a little simple HTML and Javascript magic, no development, and no recreation/duplication of content. DNN has some mobile functionality built into it, but the way it works is to actually setup a separate website altogether and duplicate your content over to that site. Bootstrap works in a much easier manner, I highly recommend you check it out if you're a developer.</p>
