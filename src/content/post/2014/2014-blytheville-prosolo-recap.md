<p>This weekend Dave and I headed down to Blytheville Arkansas for the first SCCA ProSolo of the 2014 season. I haven’t given autocross much though since Nationals in September, the primary thought I have had since then is that I figured I wouldn’t autocross much this year. The local SCCA region really put a damper on my autocross spirits last year, so I figured I might run a few National level events, but few if any local events.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago I realized the ProSolo in Blytheville was coming up, so I asked Dave if I could run the Mustang again with him, after having competed all last season in the car. He was already entered in the event, I registered about 10 days before the event. In the past 10 days, I started thinking that maybe I would autocross a bit more this year, primarily if I ran competitively in Blytheville.</p> <p>Well, long story short, it looks like I’ll be playing more golf and riding bicycles this year. The weekend overall didn’t go well for me. I think our car actually could have been competitive this weekend, but I sure as hell didn’t drive it so. I managed to get two red lights on the left course, and hit cones on the right course. I did end up getting a .500 light on my last run, on the right/north course, but within 5 seconds I think I hit a cone and ruined that run :D</p> <p>Here’s a video of my best left side run, 42.9 or something, I should have been running low 41s. The video is comprised of 2 GoPro cameras, one on the front of the car, right side, and the other was on the roof of the car with <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/cameramounts" target="_blank">my custom mount</a> on top.</p> <p>[YouTube:ezTqeewOfuc]</p>
