excerpt: "Two days ago I posted a blog about configuring a DotNetNuke development environment, in preparation for today’s blog post about a C# module development template that I recently released on Codeplex. So today’s blog post is about how to utilize the template, customizing the VSTemplate file to fit your needs with company name, namespace, email, and URL. Installing the template, and then creating a quick and easy module using the template. If you haven’t read my post about setting up your development environment I encourage you to do so before proceeding, as the steps I’m going to walk you through below assume you are running a similar environment to me. The following assumes you are using DotNetNuke V5+ and Visual Studio 2008, if you are using an older version of DNN and Visual Studio there are no guarantees that this template will do anything for you except cause pain. It’s time to upgrade folks! DNN 5 rocks!   Tags: Development,C#;Module,Module Development,DNN,Visual Studio 2008 Category: Development"
