So, all completely unofficial of course, but it looks like Lance Armstrong is getting his Nissan Leaf next week, according to a tweet he sent to <a href="https://twitter.com/lancearmstrong/status/25138975150">@leafowner earlier today</a>.<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5011972461/" title="Lance getting his Leaf next week?" style="color: #0063dc; text-decoration: underline;"><img src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/5011972461_a06a212b79_m.jpg" width="240" height="126" alt="Lance getting his Leaf next week?" class="pc_img" style="border: none;  border-image: initial;" /></a><br /> <br /> I wonder when Steve Jobs will get his? Hopefully not before Lance!<br />
