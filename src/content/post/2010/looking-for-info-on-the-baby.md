excerpt: "I haven’t blogged here on the website in a while (though I’ve blogged quite a bit elsewhere, that’s what you see here as the latest posts).  If you’re a friend on Facebook you can follow along on the status of the baby, you can also check out baby Jacqueline’s website for some updates (from twitter, on the left) and photos (from flickr on the homepage there).  As of right now Natalie is trying to sleep a little, got something to take the edge off the pain a bit, we’ll see how long that lasts and how things progress.  -Chris &amp; Natalie"
