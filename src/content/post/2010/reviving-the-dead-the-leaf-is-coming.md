excerpt: "So for those of you who have been around since the early days of this site (April 2010), you have likely noticed things have died down a bit. That's not because there hasn't been any Leaf news as of late, just that life got in the way! I had my first child a month ago and have been enjoying everything that has brought me.&nbsp;  I have been logging into the Nissan site every couple of days to see if I had an estimated delivery date, and I'm glad to say that I finally have something!&nbsp;    The site tells me I should see the Nissan Leaf sometime in the month of January!  So that's exciting, does anyone else have an estimated date yet? If so, when?  I hope everyone got to take part in the Nissan Leaf Driving Tours that are going on, I went to the event in San Jose on the 30th, I took a load of photos, they've been up on the site for a while now, but in case you haven't see them you can find them with the URL below.  https://www.leafowner.com/Pictures/vie...
