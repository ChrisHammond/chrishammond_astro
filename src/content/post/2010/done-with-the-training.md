excerpt: "So I’m finished up with the training for the week. It’s been a long week, standing all day doing training can really take it out of you! I went out to dinner tonight with another friend of mine here in town. We had a great time sitting down and talking about all things DotNetNuke.  I’m going to be here in California for another 36 hours or so, heading to the DotNetNuke Corp offices tomorrow, and then up towards Vacaville tomorrow night. I’m looking forward to catchin up with friends from High School that I haven’t seen in 5 years (we’re getting old), and others even longer than that!"
