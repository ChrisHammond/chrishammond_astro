<p>If you haven't been reading my blog lately (what's the matter with you?) you may have missed the couple of blog posts about the upcoming St. Louis Day of .NET that is going on in St. Louis. If you've missed those posts, <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryId/2717/St-Louis-Day-of-NET-Still-time-to-Go-Discounts-Available.aspx" target="_blank">check them out</a>.</p> <p>In conjunction with that event (which is on a Friday the 20th and Saturday the 21st) we've been planning another event more specific to DotNetNuke in conjunction with the local user group. We are glad to announce the next DotNetNuke Hackathon. As with the previous Hackathon events (held in Orlando and Washington DC) we will be broadcasting this event live online, and encouraging people both in St. Louis and around the world to get involved.</p> <p>This event will be held at the <a href="https://steadyrain.com" target="_blank">Steady Rain</a> offices (a <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Partners/PartnerDirectory/tabid/1330/Default.aspx" target="_blank">DotNetNuke Gold Partner</a>) in St. Louis Missouri on August 18th, 2010 at 6pm. This event will be streamed live online, visible on the <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Programs/Hackathon/tabid/1566/Default.aspx" target="_blank">DotNetNuke Hackathon</a> page so you don't have to be local to be part of the presentation and event.</p> <p>The basic premise of the Hackathon is this, we want to help stimulate your minds into doing some mobile development for DotNetNuke. To do that, we are going to be presenting a sample DotNetNuke mobile application, an application that will run on the Android Smartphone OS. We will be demonstrating how you can use some common development tools such as <a href="https://www.appcelerator.com" target="_blank">Appcelerator's Titanium Developer</a> to get up and running on developing mobile applications that interact with DotNetNuke and work on various mobile devices.</p> <p>As with the previous two Hackathon's there will be an associated development contest following the event on the 18th. We aren't limiting you to any specific project type or platform for the contest, but do suggest that you develop an application for either Android, IPhone or Windows Phone 7 devices. What your application does is completely up to you, the idea behind a Hackathon is to create a quick application that is easy to build and shows off unique functionality. You don't have to be one of the top notch developers in the DNN community to enter or even win, so start thinking of ideas for your project, there's no reason you can't start on the development right now.</p> <p>We will be announcing more details on the contest here in the next few days.</p> <p>Prior to the Hackathon myself and <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/BlogID/3/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Joe Brinkman</a> will be blogging to get you up to speed before the event on mobile development, highlighting some of the tools you can use. We are also going to be blogging about some potential project ideas for those of you who might need some inspiration to create an entry for the Hackathon contest. We will also likely be posting some sample web services for a few key DNN datasets that you might find useful in your applications, as well as highlighting how you can use other tools such as <a href="https://iweb.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">iWeb</a> to interface with DNN data from a mobile device.</p> <p>Stay tuned as we get more information together on the <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Programs/Hackathon/tabid/1566/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Hackathon page here on DotNetNuke.com</a></p> <p><strong>Right now here are some of the pertinent details</strong></p> <p>Topic: Mobile DotNetNuke</p> <p>Date: August 18, 2010</p> <p>Time: 6pm</p> <p>Location: <a href="https://steadyrain.com/" target="_blank">Steady Rain</a> Offices, 716 Geyer Avenue, Suite 400 St. Louis, Missouri 63104-4073 (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=716+Geyer+Avenue,+Suite+400+St.+Louis,+Missouri+63104-4073&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=64.409204,135.263672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=716+Geyer+Ave+%23400,+St+Louis,+Missouri+63104&amp;z=17" target="_blank">map</a>)</p> <p>Contest submission deadline: TBD, likely 8/26/2010</p> <p>Prizes: To be announced</p> <br /> <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryId/2722/Mobile-DotNetNuke-Hackathon-in-St-Louis-Missouri-on-August-18th.aspx">More ...</a>
