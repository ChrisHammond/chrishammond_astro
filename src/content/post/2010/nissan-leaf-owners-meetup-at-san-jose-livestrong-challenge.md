It was a great day for future leaf owners down in San Jose. A group of us met up at the LiveStrong Challenge event going on down there today and tomorrow to check out the Nissan Leaf that was on display.<br /> <br /> Fun was had by all,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4781382892/">though MsLusty is still there trying to find the Tailpipe on the Nissan Leaf</a>.<br /> <br /> I got down there around 10am and started testing out the camera on the Leaf. The Setup was similar to what they had at the Amgen Tour Of California back in May, though they tweaked the layout a bit. Lighting wasn't great for photos today, way too much sun on half the car, and none on the other half of the car, but I tried to make due.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Lunch was provided by Brendan from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boardwalknissan.com/" target="_blank">Boardwalk Nissan</a>, a huge thanks to him for that! Word he was able to pass on as well is that Boardwalk will not be marking up the price on the Leaf over MSRP! That's great news for all of us in the Bay Area looking forward to buying from boardwalk.<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4781381760/" title="Nissan Leaf Dashboard" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4781381760_f03a4d8cb0_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Nissan Leaf Dashboard" class="pc_img" style="border:   none;  float: right;" /></a>With the help of the lunch Brendan provided we managed to talk the reps into opening the Leaf up for us to take some photos of in inside, something that wasn't possible at the Tour of California.<br /> <br /> <br /> At the end of the day those of us remaining posed for a group shot outside of the car.<br /> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4781390300/" title="Nissan LeafOwners.com Group Shot" target="_blank" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #0063dc; text-decoration: underline;"><img src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4781390300_4f60192507_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Nissan LeafOwners.com Group Shot" class="pc_img" style="border:   none;" /></a><br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.leafowner.com/Pictures/view/setdisplay/setid/72157624465938980.aspx" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #003366; text-decoration: none;">Check out all the photos we took at the event</a>, and possibly look for them via some other venues soon!
