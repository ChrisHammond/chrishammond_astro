You can now <a style="color: rgb(203, 32, 39); text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; " href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Development/Forge/ModuleWiki/Downloads/tabid/869/Default.aspx">download the 04.02.00</a> version of the Wiki module. Here's a very brief summary of what was changed in 04.02.00.</p> <p style="color: rgb(65, 64, 66); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; ">"This release includes fixes to the Save button, cleaned up HTML code for XHTML Compliance, cleaned up isearchable code, removal of the extra BR tags inserted after LI tags, as well as an issue regarding the SEO aspects of a Wiki topic not being reused on edit.</p> <p style="color: rgb(65, 64, 66); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; ">Enhancements to the module include the extraction of the EDIT controls from the  same display as the view controls for future flexibility in modifications to the source code. A module.css file has also been added to control the width of the "index", future CSS enhancements will be added in the next few releases."</p> <p style="color: rgb(65, 64, 66); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; ">One other item of note, this version is compiled against DNN 04.09.04, which means it will run on DNN 04.09.04 or greater. If you need to run it on an older version of the platform you can download the source code and compile it yourself. Unfortunately we can't recommend running older versions of the platform.</p> <p style="color: rgb(65, 64, 66); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; ">I've got big plans for the next release of the module, and a goal of having it out in the first quarter of 2010. Stay tuned to my blog here on DotNetNuke.com as I update the Wiki features over the next few months. I'm also working on bringing a new team member on board to help out with the project, I'll make that announcement when everything is completed with the process.</p> <p style="color: rgb(65, 64, 66); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; ">Now, get Wiki'ing! </p> </div> <p> </p><a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryId/2417/Wiki-Module-Version-04-02-00-Released.aspx>More...</a><img src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnndaily/~4/dva7T9p4l3U" height="1" width="1"/>
