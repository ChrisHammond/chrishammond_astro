So I guess getting my Leaf in January isn't going to happen. I just checked NissanUsa.com and my estimated delivery date has <a href="https://www.leafowner.com/Forums/forumid/2/threadid/622/scope/posts.aspx">gone from January 2011</a> to February 2011.<br /> <br /> Anyone else have their date pushed back?
