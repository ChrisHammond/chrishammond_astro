excerpt: "Today was my last day at Engage Software as I am starting up as the Director of Training Programs with the DotNetNuke Corporation on Monday March 1st.  I’ve been working for Engage for over 5 and a half years now, and I’ve been able to enjoy what I do that entire time. Back before I started at Engage i was using DotNetNuke for my hobby websites, mainly for car racing sites, but occasionally for a few other things as well.  Engage offered me an environment where I could work with DotNetNuke every day, something I looked forward to. Over the years Engage became very embedded into the DNN world, providing a wide variety of services and products for DotNetNuke. During that time I was afforded the opportunity to become more and more involved in the DotNetNuke Project, shortly after starting at Engage being invited to join the DotNetNuke Core Team."

<p>Today was my last day at <a href="https://www.engagesoftware.com" target="_blank">Engage Software</a> as I am starting up as the Director of Training Programs with the DotNetNuke Corporation on Monday March 1st.</p>  <p>I’ve been working for Engage for over 5 and a half years now, and I’ve been able to enjoy what I do that entire time. Back before I started at Engage i was using <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> for my hobby websites, mainly for car racing sites, but occasionally for a few other things as well.</p>  <p>Engage offered me an environment where I could work with DotNetNuke every day, something I looked forward to. Over the years Engage became very embedded into the DNN world, providing a wide variety of services and products for DotNetNuke. During that time I was afforded the opportunity to become more and more involved in the DotNetNuke Project, shortly after starting at Engage being invited to join the DotNetNuke Core Team.</p>  <p>My time at Engage was like no other I could imagine. I truly enjoyed what I did everyday, from being able to post in the forums, write blogs, develop cool modules, and even getting to train people on the application I love, DotNetNuke. Had I not been at Engage I wouldn’t have travelled to Dubai, Amsterdam (twice) or all throughout the United States providing DotNetNuke Training. One of the best things about DotNetNuke is the community of people using it, and Engage allowed me to interact with that community heavily.</p>  <p>Most people think that all Engage does is provide training for DNN, which they do, but that is just a small part of their business, skin development/implementation, custom and commercial module development, custom website implementation, are just some of the other services for DNN that Engage provides. I was involved in some way with each of those services during my career at Engage, some more heavily than others.</p>  <p>I will miss the guys at Engage, it is a great group of guys, and they have a ton of things going on right now in terms of project work, some big things that I haven’t seen accomplished in the DotNetNuke world yet. I look forward to catching up with everyone when I am in St. Louis visiting our family that is still there, and hopefully at OpenForce in Las Vegas for many years to come.</p>  <p>This post probably will generate a few questions, so I’ll try to answer some of them up front.</p>  <ol>   <li>Are you moving? Didn’t you just move? Yes, and yes. Our house in Colorado is on the market and we are heading to California. California is where I consider home, <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/blog/itemid/1895/two-announcements-going-home-and-we-are-having-a" target="_blank">for more info on that read this blog post</a>.</li>    <li>Where are you moving? San Mateo, California to work out of the DNN Corp Headquarters.</li>    <li>What about the Denver DotNetNuke User’s Group? Well, if you had been at the meeting last night you would have heard that it has a new leader and secured a meeting location, so stay tuned to <a href="https://denver.dnnug.com">https://denver.dnnug.com</a> for more info.</li>    <li>Are you going to start a DNN User Group out in the Bay Area? Yes, I hope to have an announcement regarding the first meeting of that group here in the next week, tentatively plan for a meeting on 3/23 in San Mateo!</li>    <li>What will your role at DotNetNuke Corporation entail? I’ve got a lot of work to do before I can answer that question, but stay tuned in the coming months as things get up and running.</li> </ol>  <p>Come Monday morning I’ll be working out of these offices!</p>  <p><a title="Outside the DotNetNuke Corp offices in California, #dnn" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/4256628835/"><img border="0" alt="Outside the DotNetNuke Corp offices in California, #dnn" src="https://static.flickr.com/4066/4256628835_d62ef8316c.jpg" /></a></p>
