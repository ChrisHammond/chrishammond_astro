The last gap was three months, this time it was six! We're back again with Show #12 and a new special guest host, Oliver Hine. The show has a new format, is recorded in a new location (state) and will hopefully be back in the swing of being a regularly produced show again. In this episode Chris and guest Oliver Hine talk about what's been going on in the DNN World the past six months, and also the latest buzz from the previous two weeks.<img src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnnvoice/~4/Juu6KNcoS3c" height="1" width="1"/>
