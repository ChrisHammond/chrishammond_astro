excerpt: "So last year, shortly after I moved from St. Louis to Denver, I went back to St. Louis to present at the 2nd St. Louis Day of .Net. Now, having moved from Colorado to California I’m headed back to St. Louis again. Once again presenting at the St. Louis Day of .Net, August 20-21, 2010. I will be presenting my crowd favorite DotNetNuke Best Practices session, the same one, possibly tweaked a bit, I delivered in Toronto in May. This session always seems to go over well with DNN people, old and new alike.   There are a few other “big name” DotNetNuke speakers who are also rumored to be attending and submitting sessions for this year’s Day of .Net. They are still taking speaker submissions (deadline unknown?), so if you want to present a DotNetNuke session be sure to get your submissions in quick!   If you aren’t up for speaking at the event you can still attend! What good are speakers if there is no audience? Get working on your boss/employer now, start the thought process of getting them to pay for the event. At the $125 price you are going to see a plethora of great sessions about DotNetNuke and other great topics.  If you can get away from work for the event (it’s actually a two day event) I highly encourage you to check out the St. Louis Day of .Net.   You can find more info about the event at https://www.stlouisdayofdotnet.com, be sure to check out their website, guess what it runs on? DotNetNuke of course!
