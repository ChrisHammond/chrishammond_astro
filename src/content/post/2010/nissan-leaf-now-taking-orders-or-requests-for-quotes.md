<p>So Nissan has started sending out emails to &quot;request a quote&quot; from your dealer. I got mine this afternoon and jumped! We&#39;ll see what Boardwalk Nissan does now ;) (hey Brendan, remember all those kind words I had, would ya?)<br /> <br /> &quot;Hi Chris. We have some exciting news. You can now request a quote* from your local Nissan Dealer and place an order for your Nissan LEAF&trade;.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> We appreciate your support of Nissan LEAF, and we&#39;re happy to say that you&#39;ll soon be one step closer to owning one.<br /> <br /> To get started, click below.&quot;<br /> <br /> I priced the car out at just over $35k, and said I was interested in Leasing the car. I figure if I&#39;m ever going to lease a car this will be it. I don&#39;t hold on to cars for very long, so a 3 year Lease will actually be pushing it for me, but I&#39;m gonna be a father soon, perhaps it&#39;s time to grow up :D&nbsp;</p>
