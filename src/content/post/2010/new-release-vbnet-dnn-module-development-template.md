excerpt: "A few weeks ago (heck it’s been a couple of months now, my how time flies) I put together a couple of blog posts about module development using the WAP project type. They were how to setup your environment, how to customize a visual studio template, and how to use NANT to automate packaging of your projects.  Well, it took me some time but I finally got a VB.Net template together using the same approach as my C# template. I’ve also put together a new C# template (with a minor change to the location of the uninstall.sqldataprovider file). If you are looking to get started with DNN module development be sure to check out the posts!  Be sure to read those three original blog posts, you’ll get some good info on how to:     Setup your environment    Customize the templates    Setup NANT to automate the build/packaging of your projects.   If you missed the free Basic Module Development webinar I delivered a couple of weeks ago, check out the video from that to get you jump started with some module development.  You can get the two free templates from codeplex.  I’ve been told these templates will work in VS2008 Express, though I haven’t tested them myself. I also believe that these will work in VS2010 if you want to try them there as well.  One question that comes up when I talk about the Templates that I’ve created is why they aren’t in the DotNetNuke Starter kit that you can download from Codeplex. I intend for them to be rolled into that package, but they didn’t make it into the upcoming DNN 5.5 release, I hope to get them into a future release here soon.  I’m also working on a sample project for DNN restful web services for some demonstrations for the St. Louis Hackathon (you can watch and enter the contest even if you aren’t in St. Louis!), it will be hosted on codeplex as well. I hope to have some of that sample code (developed using the C# template of course) on Tuesday.More ...Tags: DNN,Module,Development,DotNetNuke,Template,visual studio,2008,2010Category: CommunityCategory: Extension ForgeCategory: ReferenceCategory: Development"
