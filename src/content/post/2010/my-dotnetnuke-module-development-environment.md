<p>So this is the first in a series of promised blog posts that I am long overdue on! These posts are a follow up to a <a target="_blank" href="https://web3.dotnetnuke.com/Products/DotNetNukeTraining/tabid/1299/Default.aspx">Beginning DotNetNuke Module Development webinar</a> that we provided back on May 17th. If you didn’t attend the webinar you missed out, but you do get to benefit from these blog posts if you want to easily get setup and running with C# module development for DotNetNuke.</p> <p>This first post will be discussing the development environment that I configure when I am doing DotNetNuke module development, in addition to this post I’ve got a post about a free Visual Studio template that I am releasing on Codeplex that makes setting up your first DNN module very easy. As well as another blog post about using NANT to automate the packaging of your DNN modules so that you can easily deploy them to other environments.</p> <p> </p><img src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnndaily/~4/_ZxcxWJcZSI" height="1" width="1"/>
