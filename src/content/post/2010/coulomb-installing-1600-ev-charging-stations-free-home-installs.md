excerpt: " So apparently Coulomb Technologies will be announcing (on Thursday July 8th) that they received a grant to install 1600 charging stations in certain parts of California. I'm not quite clear on if these will be home charging stations or something else, but if they are home stations let me be first on the list! I'm in the target area, between San Francisco and San Jose! Apparently they will also be available in Sacramento and Los Angeles. If anyone from Coulomb reads this, consider me totally interested. I'll gladly share all sorts of data! :)  source autoblog green  "
