We will be developing a module that you can walk away with at the end of the session, in either VB or C#. In the morning session I will go through the basics of what we will be creating, the afternoon will be spent actually building the module in lab sessions. I, as well as other DNN Corp employees, will be walking around helping everyone with the process of doing the building of the module. You can do your development in either C# or VB, whatever you choose, we will provide source code examples and support for both.</p> <div class="category">Category: <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/CatID/16/Default.aspx">Community</a></div> <div class="category">Category: <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/CatID/14/Default.aspx">Events</a></div> <div class="category">Category: <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/CatID/9/Default.aspx">Development</a></div> <div class="category">Category: <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/CatID/15/Default.aspx">DotNetNuke Corporation</a></div><img src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnndaily/~4/GgDfBk0ntyo" height="1" width="1"/>
