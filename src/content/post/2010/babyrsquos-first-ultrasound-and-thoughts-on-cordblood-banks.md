<p>Today was our first ultrasound, we got the see our baby's heartbeat for the first time. HOLY CRIKEY this just got really real, in a good way. Natalie was brought to tears, I realized this as my cue to get up from my chair and hold her hand!</p>  <p><a title="Our First Ultrasound! by chrishammond, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4388483219/"><img alt="Our First Ultrasound!" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2786/4388483219_823c4a4276_o.jpg" width="598" height="447" /></a></p>  <p>Based on the ultrasound we are now told our due date is 10/1/2010, not near as cool as 10/10/10, but it will have to do! My buddy Jim will be pulling for us to delay a day and go 10/2/10 in honor of his birthday. Dude will be 34 by then, crikey he’s old :)</p>  <p>So we are getting more and more excited about the coming baby. In the doctor’s office today I picked up a flyer for a cord-blood bank, something I had never heard of before this morning. I read through the flyer and the basic gist is they will take your baby’s umbilical cord blood and cryogenically store it for an amount of time in case you need it. They say the stem cells in cord blood can be used to cure all sorts of diseases. I thought this sounded like a cool idea, and figured I would check out the pricing: basically it was $150 for the kit to collect and ship the blood back to the cord-blood bank.</p>  <p>Then you paid something like $1800 for 18 years of storage, or $96/mo, or $65/mo for a two year term. Kind of pricey I thought. So I thought about that, and figured I would do some research over the coming months to see if this is something we wanted to do. Well, low and behold I loaded up <a href="https://www.msn.com/" target="_blank">MSN.com</a> this evening (putting off packing for the trip to California) and saw a headline talking about cord-blood banks! <a href="https://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thehumancondition/archive/2010/02/22/cord-blood-banks-called-wrong-but-who-s-right.aspx?GT1=43002" target="_blank">Off to read it I went</a>.</p>  <p>Take a read yourself, the basic gist of the article, and the feedback from the various doctors and medical societies mentioned in the article is that private cord-blood banks are pretty much a waste of money. So now I have it in my head that we don’t use a cord-blood bank, but we’ve got another 7 months or so to decide, we’ll see what happens in that time frame and what other research says.</p>  <p>Now I’m off to work on packing more, we’ve got a long road trip starting in the morning.</p>
