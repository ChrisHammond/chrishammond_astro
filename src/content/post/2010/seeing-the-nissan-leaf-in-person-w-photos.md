excerpt: "So today my wife and I headed up to Sacramento (110 miles or so from where we live). In case you hadn't heard there's this little thing going on in the state this week, called the Amgen Tour Of California, only the largest bicycle race in the United States. While I have attended a bike race or two in the past, and taken quite a few photos at them, the race itself was not the reason we headed up there. On Friday we received an email that Nissan would be travelling around with the bike race with a Nissan Leaf in tow, setting up at the finish festivals letting the public see the car. Since I registered for the opportunity to purchase a Leaf on 4/20, I've been stoked about this whole process, and I just had to see the car in person. So the wife and I hopped into the Project350z and drove up to Sacramento for a few hours. We got up there, found a decent parking space and headed off to walk around the various vendors trying to track down the Leaf! We ended up seeing all the vendors and finding the Nissan booth last. I spent probably an hour or so there, taking various photos, looking the car over, and talking to various reps who were there. Unfortunately the car was pretty much on lockdown, you could get close to it, but couldn't open up any of the fun parts! The windows were up on this sunny beautiful day, and unfortunately that caused for some glare problems with trying to take interior pictures. I took 152 photos, but after trying to filter through some of them we've uploaded a large number of them. Hopefully by taking a look at some of these photos you'll see different things on the Leaf that you might not have seen in other photos that have been published elsewhere.  We didn't learn too much different from the event, but it was nice to see the car in person. The only major thing I learned was that in addition to the $7500 government tax credit, California residents may be able to get a $5000 tax rebate, as well as the rebates for the charger installation. That could really make the Leaf a no brainer! Here are some of the photos, though be sure to check out the full listing of photos from the Amgen Tour Of California Stage 1  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "
