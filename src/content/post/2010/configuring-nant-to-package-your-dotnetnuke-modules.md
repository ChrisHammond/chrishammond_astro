excerpt: "So this is the third and final post in the module development series of blogs I started last week. The first two covered      Configuring your development environment     Customizing and installing a C# module development template  This post is going to tell you how to utilize an open source project called NAnt to package up your modules quickly and easily, so that they can be installed on various DotNetNuke sites. The C# module development template that I released last week comes with a NAnt BUILD script included, so when you create a project using the template (as we do in blog #2) you are ready to use NAnt to package the module, you must get NAnt configure though, so let’s walk through that process.Tags: DotNetNuke Module Development,Training,Module,Template,NANT,C#,Compile,Package,DeployCategory: Development"
