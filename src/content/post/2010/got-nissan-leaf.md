Update: I sold leafowner.com a long time ago, links are removed as they no longer work

Did you get in on the Nissan Leaf preregistration event last week? Well I did, and I'm excited about it! So excited that I went and did something, I purchased a domain name and setup a website for it (running on DotNetNuke of course)!
 
Check out the website at leafowner.com
 
I've setup some forums and started posting a few news bits. I hope to update the site daily with the latest in Leaf news! If you're interested in contributing to the site check it out and shoot @LeafOwner a message on twitter!
 
I still need to get a logo together, any designers out there interested in putting something together?
 
Chris Hammond excited about an electric car? Yeah, weird eh? but I'm all about this! Stay tuned!
