excerpt: "So we’re getting down to the final hours before the Hackathon, and those of us attending are getting ready for our trips! Nik and I both arrive from California tomorrow afternoon, while Joe is coming into St. Louis earlier in the day.  Wednesday (the 18th, tonight, depending on when you read this) we will be broadcasting the Hackathon kickoff from St. Louis DotNetNuke User Group. You will be able watch the session live, or watch the recordings later on.  The Hackathon contest will run until the 25th, when entries are due. For all the details on the event itself check out the rules and other details posted on https://hackathon.in   The live broadcast and video playback will occur here on DotNetNuke.com.   Why should you enter the Hackathon, even if you aren’t there attending live? You can win some great prizes!   There will be more blog posts coming in the next few days from both Joe Brinkman and myself as we post more details about mobile development and DNN.  For now, if you need some project ideas, here are some that ANYONE can create a project for. Most of these things will need a web service created to expose this data, I’ll have examples for you to see how to easily do this later this week!  An app to review your website Site Log data  An app to monitor your Event Log  An app to access the DNN Dashboard (host)  An app that exposes a user’s “work” from the HTML module  An app to list of blog posts and comments for the DNN blog module  An app to read and post data to the DNN Forum module  An app to interact with any other DNN module!  Don’t let our suggestions limit you in anyway, they are by no means the only things you could develop, in fact we encourage you to think outside of the box, they are just there to get your gears turning on something for the contest. These apps don’t need to be highly complex either, just a simple mobile app to perform a function is fine.   We will be releasing a sample application here this week as well that does a few different things with DNN that I think you will find very cool! I know I’ve used it and it’s pretty damn sweet to see!More ...Tags: DNN,Hackathon,Development,Module,extensions,Android,Iphone,MobileCategory: EventsCategory: Extension ForgeCategory: Development"
