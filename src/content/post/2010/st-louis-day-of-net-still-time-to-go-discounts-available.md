<p><a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryId/2684/St-Louis-Day-of-Net-2010.aspx" target="_blank">A few weeks ago I posted</a> about the upcoming <a href="https://www.stlouisdayofdotnet.com" target="_blank">St. Louis Day(s) of .NET</a> that is happening later this month (8/20-21). Well the event is only a few short weeks away, and guess what, I’ve got discount codes! If you are interested in going to the event email me (<a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.comhttps://www.dotnetnuke.commailto:training@dnncorp.com">training@dnncorp.com</a>) and I can get you $75 off the $200 entry fee. I only have a few of these though, so if you want to get one you need to act fast! Also, the earlier you sign up the more likely you are to get some of the free event swag that comes for earlier registrations, they are only ordering so many shirts and other things to give away.</p>  <p>The event already has over 500 registrations, and there are quite a few DotNetNuke oriented sessions and speakers, including some from myself, Joe Brinkman, Nik Kalyani, Mitchel Sellers, Shawn Mehaffie, Ian Robinson and Cuong Dang. (if I missed any DNN folk I apologize). Also, if you get into St. Louis earlier, say on Wednesday the 18th there’s a little event going on that we’ll be announcing tomorrow (Monday the 2nd).</p>  <p>So get your travel plans moving and email <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.comhttps://www.dotnetnuke.commailto:training@dnncorp.com">training@dnncorp.com</a> to get a discount code! I’ve only got a limited number of discount codes I can give out, so act fast! <a href="https://www.stlouisdayofdotnet.com/">https://www.stlouisdayofdotnet.com/</a></p><br /><a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryId/2717/St-Louis-Day-of-NET-Still-time-to-Go-Discounts-Available.aspx>More ...</a><div class="tags">Tags: St. Louis,Day of .NET,DNN,Event,Missouri</div><div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/CatID/16/Default.aspx>Community</a></div><div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/CatID/14/Default.aspx>Events</a></div><img src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnndaily/~4/jHAP0fBDd9g" height="1" width="1"/>
