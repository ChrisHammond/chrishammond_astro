Autoblog Green is reporting that Lance Armstrong is going to be getting the first Nissan Leaf, sometime in September.<br /> <br /> Lance has likely had a hell of a day, with all the BS from Landis, then getting into a bad wreck during the Amgen Tour Of California and having to head to the hospital. Lance's #ATOC run might be over, but at least he gets a great car come September! Those of us here at LeafOwner.com are definitely going to be jealous when that happens!<br /> <br /> Source: <a href="https://green.autoblog.com/2010/05/20/breaking-first-nissan-leaf-going-to-lance-armstrong-in-septembe/">Autoblog Green</a>
