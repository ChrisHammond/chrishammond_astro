Nissan sent out an online survey asking about warranty and battery life for the Nissan Leaf.<br /> <br /> From reading through the survey it looks like they are considering 5yr/60k warranties, or 8yr/100k warranties.<br /> <br /> There is definitely a lot of information in the survey, and they ask a lot of "what would it take to make you not buy a Leaf". I was pretty strict on I won't accept a 5yr/60k mile warranty, I have no interest in the risk of being an early adopter of the Nissan Leaf if they aren't going to back the product with a very rigid warranty.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4800083607/" title="Nissan Leaf Survey" style="color: #1057ae; text-decoration: underline;"><img src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4800083607_c16799f2a3_m.jpg" width="197" height="240" alt="Nissan Leaf Survey" class="pc_img" style="border: none;  border-image: initial;" /></a><br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.leafowner.com/Pictures/view/setdisplay/setid/72157624517927854.aspx">Here are a couple more screenshots from the Survey</a><br /> <br /> What was your overall response to the survey? Did you get it today? Did you fill it out? What do you think the Warranty should be?
