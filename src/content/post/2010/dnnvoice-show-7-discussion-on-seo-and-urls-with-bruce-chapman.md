<p>Here’s Show #7 of the DNNVoice. This show is in a different format due to our busy schedules, but hopefully you will find it useful, I know I did when I gave it a listen! Chris talks about OpenForce and OpenForce Europe’s call for speakers (https://www.sdc.nl/cfs), Tom interviews Bruce Chapman.</p><img src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnnvoice/~4/1eQb0GqVbCM" height="1" width="1"/>
