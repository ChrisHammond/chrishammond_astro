excerpt: "Five years ago today (1/29) I met my beautiful wife Natalie. We went out on our first date to Applebee’s in Ballwin Missouri. It was a Saturday, we had talked online a time or two, and on the phone this particular evening. We met up for a late dinner and ended up staying until they kicked us out.  Shortly there after we both took our Match.com profiles down (yes, we met thru Match.com).   I love you beautiful!"
