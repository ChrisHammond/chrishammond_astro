<p>So if you've been under a rock lately you might not have heard that the annual <a href="https://devconnections.com/shows/FALL2010DN/default.asp?s=158" target="_blank">DotNetNuke conference</a> is coming up. While in the past it has been branded as OpenForce, this year it is just simply <a href="https://devconnections.com/shows/FALL2010DN/default.asp?s=158" target="_blank">DotNetNuke Connections</a>, to better fit inline with the DevConnections banner.</p> <p>This years event is once again going to be held in conjunction with <a href="https://www.devconnections.com" target="_blank">DevConnections</a> in <strong>Las Vegas Nevada, November 1-4</strong>. The conference is at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, a great venue that has been the amazing home to the DotNetNuke conference for the previous three years.</p> <p>This years event promises to be even better than the previous three years, (some <a href="https://local.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/BlogID/239/Default.aspx" target="_blank">smart*ss</a> will say that is because of what my next sentence says). I'll be making my fourth appearance at the conference, though this time I'm not presenting a session at the conference.</p>
