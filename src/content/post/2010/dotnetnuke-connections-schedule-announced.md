excerpt: "So if you’ve been under a rock lately you might not have heard that the annual DotNetNuke conference is coming up. While in the past it has been branded as OpenForce, this year it is just simply DotNetNuke Connections, to better fit inline with the DevConnections banner.  This years event is once again going to be held in conjunction with DevConnections in Las Vegas Nevada, November 1-4. The conference is at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, a great venue that has been the amazing home to the DotNetNuke conference for the previous three years.  This years event promises to be even better than the previous three years, (some smart*ss will say that is because of what my next sentence says). I’ll be making my fourth appearance at the conference, though this time I’m not presenting a session at the conference.  "
