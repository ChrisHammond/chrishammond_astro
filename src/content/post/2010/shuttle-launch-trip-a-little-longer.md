excerpt: "So the space shuttle launch trip is going to be longer than planned, possibly. We are waiting to see when it will launch after this morning’s scheduled launch was scrubbed last minute. Hopefully the launch attempt on Monday morning goes off as planned. Terec and I are down here, ready for the next attempt, and willing to stay longer if delays occur, but I’ve got so much going on right now getting home would be great!  I’ll post photos and such over the next couple days if things turn out. So far we’ve not gotten anything great from the photos, too windy and dark."
