<p>So tonight I took for for San Francisco, it wasn’t too far, about an hour drive from my hotel down to Pier 39, maybe a little further due to traffic. I got the camera out, and after fighting with the parking meter headed off to take some photos. I hit the Pier for a while, taking a collection of photos, and then headed off to find Lombard street, the windy part. Fortunately I’ve been using my Droid (phone) for navigation this trip, and using the google Maps application it was easy to locate that section of the road and simply touch the screen to get the phone to tell me exactly how to get there. I drove around until I found the “entrance” and then wound my way down the road.</p>  <p>No photos of Lombard, but trust me it was interesting, neat little road, though I can’t imagine being one of those people who live on it. From there I had the Droid point me towards the Golden Gate Bridge for some photos of that. I ended up finding my way to a little park off to the side of the bridge, and took a number of photos. I’ve yet to look at them on the laptop to see if they turned out or not, but I think I got one or two that should work.</p>  <p>It’s late here, almost midnight, and I need to get up in 6 hours to try to buy shuttle launch tickets, so I’ll have to look at the photos in the morning. (for those keeping track, this is blog post #5, on Day 5, of 2010, I made it in just before midnight, here in California time, even though the posting time on the site will show almost 3am EST where the server is located).</p>  <p>Alright, I couldn’t resist, here are two photos, first San Francisco City Hall, then the Golden Gate Bridge with a ship passing underneath</p>  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4250597054/"><img border="0" alt="San Francisco City Hall" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4250597054_78df027ea8_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" /></a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4249824125/"><img border="0" alt="Golden Gate Bridge" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4249824125_b0bfc63282_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" /></a></p>
