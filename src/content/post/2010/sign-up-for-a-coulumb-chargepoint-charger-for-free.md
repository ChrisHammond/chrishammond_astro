It looks like the announcement from Coulomb came out today, though they haven't come out and said anything official (from what I can find) about if they will be giving some free chargers out for home use. You can "Request" or suggest a location for their Chargepoint network, I've done it, not sure it will work or not, but worth a shot.<br /> <a href="https://www.mychargepoint.net/request-station.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.mychargepoint.net/request-...</a><br /> <br /> <a href="https://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/07/coulomb-to-install-1600-california-ev-chargers-in-12-million-program.html">original source Edmunds</a>
