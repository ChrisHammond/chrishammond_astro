<p>Keep them doggies rolling, is that how it goes? That’s how we go. We’re in Carlin Nevada tonight, on our way to California hoping to find a truck full of our stuff there on Friday.</p>  <p>Today we went through Wyoming, Utah and some of Nevada. We had sun, rain, wind, fog, sand storms, salt storms, and even got attacked by thousands of tumble weeds. But we made it. Hotel here lost power for a bit due to wind. Here’s a shot of the salt flats today, I’ve got more (near whiteout conditions) on the camera that I will upload when we get to California. </p>  <p><img src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4559392988_a7ecd1669f.jpg" /></p>  <p>That’s all for tonight, gotta sleep and do some work in the morning before we hopefully complete the rest of the drive to San Carlos.</p>
