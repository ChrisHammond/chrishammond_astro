So have your dealers started calling you to ask what your order date is? I got a call from Boardwalk today. I said very positive things about Brendan, I hope that doesn't come back to burn me ;)<br /> <br /> I was told by the GM that there would likely be no test drives before they get a demo vehicle in December, I sure as help hope that isn't true. Nissan has been saying driving tours will happen sometime this fall.
