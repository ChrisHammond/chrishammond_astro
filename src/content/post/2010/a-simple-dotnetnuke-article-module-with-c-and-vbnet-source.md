excerpt: "For the DotNetNuke Connections conference last month I provided an advanced DotNetNuke module development course as a pre-conference training session. That training covered details on how to implement some of the newer features in the DotNetNuke platform within custom modules, mainly ContentItem integration and Taxonomy features.  For the course I created a very basic Article module for DotNetNuke, ultimately naming it DNNSimpleArticle. For the course I created both a C# and a VB.NET version of the module. Since that course offering I’ve cleaned things up a bit more in the module and just tonight uploaded it to Codeplex at https://dnnsimplearticle.codeplex.com. Please read the full blog post for details on the module, and a few warnings (this module is not supported, use at your own risk)  Tags: DNN,Module,Article,ArticlesCategory: Extension ForgeCategory: DevelopmentCategory: DotNetNuke Corporation"
