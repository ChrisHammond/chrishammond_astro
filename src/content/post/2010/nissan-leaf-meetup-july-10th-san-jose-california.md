We're in the early phases of planning a little gathering in San Jose on July 10th. There will be a Leaf on static display at a Livestrong event down there.<br /> <br /> I'm thinking 10 or 11am, but need to find more information about the event.<br /> <br /> Thanks to Brendan Dolan from <a href="https://www.boardwalknissan.com/">Boardwalk Nissan</a> for the tip on the event!<br /> <br /> Stay tuned for more info as we get the planning together! If you're interested in attending please reply to this thread!
