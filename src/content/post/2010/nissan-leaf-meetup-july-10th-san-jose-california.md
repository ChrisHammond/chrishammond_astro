excerpt: "We're in the early phases of planning a little gathering in San Jose on July 10th. There will be a Leaf on static display at a Livestrong event down there.  I'm thinking 10 or 11am, but need to find more information about the event.  Thanks to Brendan Dolan from Boardwalk Nissan for the tip on the event!  Stay tuned for more info as we get the planning together! If you're interested in attending please reply to this thread!"
