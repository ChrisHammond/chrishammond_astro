excerpt: "This evening I was working on creating a Full Width skin for a car racing site I’ve worked on for a number of years. The site has a very active Forum running on DotnetNuke 5.6.0 and the 5.0.0 release of the DotNetNuke Forum module. The problem with the site is it is a fixed width design and that doesn’t’ work well for many forums.  Basically I wanted a three column layout where the middle column stretched out as wide as possible, and depending on if there was content in the Left and Right columns, I wanted them to not display at all, causing the Middle column to expand to fill the void.
