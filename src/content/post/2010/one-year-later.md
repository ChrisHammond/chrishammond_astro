<p>So it was a year ago today, we signed the papers on our house in Parker Colorado. Our first home purchase, after making a big move from St. Louis Missouri, we had settled down in Parker. Six months later, the house was on the market, and a year later, here we are, in San Carlos California living in a totally different house.</p>  <p>Things have changed, we’re expecting our first child in October, I’ve changed jobs, and the house has been on the market for almost 6 months now. We have an offer and should have it under contract hopefully later today, 1yr since we purchased it.</p>  <p>We definitely miss Colorado, but also love it here in California. We miss most our wonderful neighbors and friends, Kim and Mike. The new owners of our home (assuming everything goes through) will have some of the best neighbors ever!</p>
