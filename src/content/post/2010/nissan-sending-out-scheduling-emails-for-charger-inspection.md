We got a nice surprise from Nissan today, an email about getting our charger inspection setup! We've scheduled for 7/1/2010!<br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4707768412/">Here's a screenshot of the email</a><br /> <br /> Did you get the same email? When did you get scheduled for? Did anyone get turned off by the additional $100 charge to set this up?
