I started up here at DotNetNuke Corporation here just over 11 weeks ago now, I guess I am really finishing my 12th week here tomorrow. I was employee #26 I believe, and since I started I believe we’ve grown even more and are now in the range of 38 or 39 employees! Possibly 40 if you count <a href="https://www.willstrohl.com/Blog/EntryId/575/LITERALLY-Living-the-Dream-DotNetNuke-Style" target="_blank" style="color: #003366; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Will Strohl but he’s not starting up for a while</a>, and he never really counts for much anyways (for those that don’t know, Will and I rip on each other when we blog)! There are two primary offices for DNN, one in San Mateo, California where I work, and one in Langley, Canada outside of Vancouver, though there are also a few remote workers over in the UK, Australia and even spread around the United States.<a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryId/2613/Moving-on-up-to-the-west-side.aspx>More...</a><img src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnndaily/~4/NiC8LYnXBVc" height="1" width="1"/>
