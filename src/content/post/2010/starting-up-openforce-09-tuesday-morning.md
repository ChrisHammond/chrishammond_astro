<p>So OpenForce 09 is starting up. Scott Guthrie (The Gu) is doing his ASP.NET 4.0/VS 2010 presentation, the main keynote for Tuesday morning here in Las Vegas.</p>  <p>Most everyone got to Vegas yesterday and immediately those of us on Twitter started to locate each other and get together to say hello to old friends, meet new ones, and get some food! For those of you who have never been to the west coast, you may not have ever heard of In-N-Out Burger. It's a chain, I believe all owned by the same family, primarily in California, though there are a few locations in Arizona, Nevada and one in Utah. I organized a gathering to head over to the one not far from the hotel Monday at noon. Unfortunately I spent Monday morning here in Vegas at a dentist due to some pain that started as soon as I got off the plane. The rest of the guys met up and caught a cab or two over to In-N-Out for lunch, I was able to catch a cab from the dentist and meet up with everyone who made it over there for lunch.</p>  <p>I had a great time introducing everyone to the wonders of In-n-Out, I'm not sure if they liked the food or not, but I sure did. I try to make it there at least once every time I come to Vegas for OpenForce. After that we walked back to the hotel, catching up on everyone's happenings since the last time we were together. The rest of the afternoon was spent getting checked into the conference and locating people as they arrived for the week. I don't know how many people are actually registered for the DNN side of the conference but most of my friends are here, so I'm enjoying the people. That is why I actually love the conferences, the people, catching up, meeting new, and just geeking out over things with everyone else.</p>  <p>Monday night some of us met up and went to Burger Bar for dinner. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4093223140/"><img alt="IMG_1821" border="0" height="180" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2538/4093223140_b22a0e6919_m.jpg" width="240" /></a> If you want to see what everyone is doing this week be sure to check out Twitter, you can search for the hash tag #OpenForce as a lot of us are tweeting about events and such.</p>  <p>This is the first day for the conference, things are just getting started, as they do I'll post more (assuming I can get a solid internet connection). I may end up playing with a new toy I got this week, a Motorola Droid, to see if I can use that for my internet connection here at the conference, with 2500 people at the conference the free Wiki right now isn't holding up to well. Which could become an issue for me during my presentation tomorrow about interacting with Facebook using DNN. We'll see how that goes ;)</p>  <p>Shaun's keynote starts at 10am PST, so I'll try to blog again during/after that session to let people know about all the new announcements! Stay tuned for some cool things.</p>  <p>You can get more media from openforce at https://openforce.r2ismash.com (dead link)</p>  <p>Also be sure&nbsp; to check out our DNNVoice Podcast later tonight, I'm going to be doing audio blurbs from people here at OpenForce throughout the day and trying to get a short file uploaded each night. Not a full blown podcast like Tom and I try to do (somewhat frequently). We'll see how the internet connection holds out for that as well!</p>  <p><img height="1" src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnndaily/~4/fGcujkgKul0" width="1" /></p>
