<p>Last year for New Years we hit the slopes. That was the only time in 2009 that we did. Today, for New Years 2010, we hit the slopes again, though this time it is hopefully the start of an active year for us in the mountains! We took our neighbors to Arapahoe Basin early this morning, leaving the house at 5:15, and getting there at 7am, not bad considering we stopped and stocked up at 7-11, and also went over Loveland Pass in whiteout conditions. The passengers in the vehicle didn’t care for that ride, but I didn’t mind it, I knew enough of where I was going that I didn’t need to see the road :)</p>  <p>We had a blast today, though I know I am going to be paying for the fun over the next few days. I’ll get some pictures posted of the action over the next couple of days.</p>  <p>Hope everyone had a great New Years, welcome to 2010!</p>
