<p><strong>UPDATE: sorry folks the washer and dryer are sold!</strong><br /> <br /> So this weekend only, if you're interested in buying our house you can get the washer/dryer included in the deal! You gotta act fast though, they are going on Craigslist, if they sell there they won't be available as part of the house deal.</p> <p>They are a really nice washer/dryer set to! Front loaders, Samsung, I don't have the model numbers handy, but they were over $2k less than 8 months ago when purchased new.</p> <p>For a little more on our house check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ourcoloradolife.com/Blog/itemId/156/17960-Domingo-Dr-Parker-CO-80134-For-Sale-we-ha.aspx ">https://www.ourcoloradolife.com/Blog/itemId/156/17960-Domingo-Dr-Parker-CO-80134-For-Sale-we-ha.aspx&nbsp;</a></p>
