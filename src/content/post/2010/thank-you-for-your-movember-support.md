<p>So earlier this year I had this thought, DotNetNuke should do something in support of Movember (the annual month of November where you grow a mustache for the month in support of raising awareness for Menâ€™s health). I thought about it, and thought about it, and about let it slide right by without doing anything about it. But at the last minute I got things rolling, and I must say, it turned out way better than I had imagined!</p>  <p>Check out the full post for all the details, and a YouTube video of the DotNetNuke team members who participated.</p>  <div class="tags">Tags: DotNetNuke,Movember,DNN,Mustache</div><div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/tabid/825/CatID/16/Default.aspx>Community</a></div><div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/tabid/825/CatID/15/Default.aspx>DotNetNuke Corporation</a></div><img src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnndaily/~4/ZsFGkGH9Ido" height="1" width="1"/>
