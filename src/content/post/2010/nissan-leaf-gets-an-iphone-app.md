excerpt: "I must say I saw this coming, but hopefully it won't be the only thing we see for the Leaf in terms of mobile applications. According to Autoblog Green the Leaf will be getting a simple Iphone app that will allow you to tell the car to either warm or cool the interior, as well as check the charging status of your Leaf. While that is cool, autoblog goes a little sarcastic and complains they want to be able to drive the car remotely.  I'll just be happy if Nissan creates an Android application, or releases an SDK! I would love to try my hand at my own Android application for the car if the opportunity ever presents itself. I'll be damned if I'll buy an IPhone :)&nbsp;  Read the full ABG post."
