<p>I’m going to be in Toronto providing some DNN training for a <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Products/EliteEdition/tabid/1341/Default.aspx">DotNetNuke Elite Edition</a> customer next week, and guess what? There just happens to be a TADUG meeting next week! Guess who is presenting? If you are anywhere near the Toronto area you should come to the <a href="https://www.tadug.ca/">Toronto Area DotNetNuke User Group</a> meeting on the 12th of May, a week from Today. </p> <p>A big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/paulscarlett">Paul Scarlett</a> for getting this organized. I’ve known Paul for a few years now, and he seems to follow me around a bit as I’ve run into him in Florida and Vegas a few times, but this time I am going to his hood. This is actually going to be my first trip to the great state of Canada, it is one of the 51 states right? ;)<br /> <br /> Read the full blog post for more details</p><a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryId/2598/Toronto-DotNetNuke-User-Group-meeting-on-5-12-2010.aspx>More...</a><img src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnndaily/~4/5lRMSKEgU6U" height="1" width="1"/>
