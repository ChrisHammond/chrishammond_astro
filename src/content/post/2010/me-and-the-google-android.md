<p>Tonight after another day of DotNetNuke training I went up to Mountain View to meet up with a friend for dinner. This friend used to live/race cars in St. Louis, but now lives out here in California and works for Google. I took the opportunity to drive up to the Google campus and take a look around a bit. I also realized that the exit for the Campus is the exit in which I got into my first car accident, back in 1995. We were on our way to a Live (the band) concert, and I ran into the stopped traffic at the exit, a friend then running into me.</p>  <p>Tonight we had dinner at an Italian place over on Castro, and then made our way back to campus so he could show me around a little bit. I had to take the opportunity for a photo of me standing out in front of this giant Android at the Android building on campus.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4253459266/"><img border="0" alt="Google Android" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4253459266_04983d7684_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" /></a></p>  <p>Talking with my friend was interesting, hearing about the culture and things going on at Google. Nothing secret, though I did try to pry, he wouldn’t spill anything! I’m once again motivated to start working on an Android application, maybe I’ll get to do that over the next week. I would try to spend my flight to Rhode Island on Sunday doing this, but I know the battery in this laptop won’t last me long enough on the flight. </p>  <p>I’ve got one more day of training, tomorrow, and then Friday I’m off to have some fun for the day.</p>
