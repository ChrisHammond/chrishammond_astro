excerpt: "It looks like www.OurColoradoLife.com and of course the precursor, www.going2colorado.com are quickly coming to an end. As of yesterday we have a signed contract on our house in Parker Colorado. Hopefully by this time next month we'll be free and clear of the house and able to move on with our lives here in California."
