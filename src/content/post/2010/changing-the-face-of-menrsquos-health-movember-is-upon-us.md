excerpt: "Some of you have likely heard of Movember, some of you have likely not. So here’s the quick and dirty basics about the Month of Movember borrowed from the Official site.  “Movember challenges men to change their appearance and the face of men’s health by growing a moustache. The rules are simple, start Movember 1st  clean-shaven and then grow a moustache for the entire month.  The moustache becomes the ribbon for men’s health, the means by which awareness and funds are raised for cancers that affect men.  Much like the commitment to run or walk for charity, the men of Movember commit to growing a moustache for 30 days. ” https://us.movember.com/about/  So what the heck does this have to do with DotNetNuke? Well, not much, except that cancer effects everyone, man and woman, geek and jock. the same. I’ve created a DotNetNuke Movember team for the Employees and Community to join and participate in for 2010. To join the team visit https://us.movember.com/register/104438 and follow the steps. I’ll personally donate $1* to every person’s donation campaign that joins the DotNetNuke team on Movember.com to help you get started.   Category: Community Category: Events Category: DotNetNuke Corporation"
