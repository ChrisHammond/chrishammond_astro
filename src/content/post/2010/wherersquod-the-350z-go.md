So it’s been a while since I’ve done any updates here on Project350z.com, so here’s a quick update.  The car has been doing well the past few months but at this point has been relegated to strictly commuter duty, and it will likely be that way for a while now. Though I do hope to hit an event or two here in the coming months, hopefully on towards the end of June and another 2 or 3 in July. <a href="https://www.autocrossblog.com/whered-the-350z-go">Read More at www.autocrossblog.com</a>
