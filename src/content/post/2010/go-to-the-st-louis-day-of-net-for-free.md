<p>Are you interested in going to the <a href="https://www.stlouisdayofdotnet.com" target="_blank">St. Louis Day of .NET</a> next week? Did you fail to get your boss to approved the entry fee of $200 for this excellent two day event?</p>  <p><strong>Well have I got a deal for you! </strong></p>  <p>I’ve got a free entry to the St. Louis Day of .NET that I am going to give away. That means you have a chance to go for free, you don’t have to pay the $200 entry fee, but here’s the deal. You need to earn the free entry! </p>  <p>To get the free entry you need to write a blog post about what you are most interested in seeing/learning (choosing <a href="https://www.stlouisdayofdotnet.com/Sessions.aspx" target="_blank">from the list of sessions</a>) at the event next Friday and Saturday. </p>  <p>Once you’ve blogged about it, post the URL to your blog post in the comments here on my blog. You must post your blog by Monday at 5pm PDT, and from those submissions I will randomly choose one who will get to go to the event for free.</p>  <p>Remember, the entry fee covers the event, and even food (breakfast/lunch both days) at the event!</p>  <p>Of the remaining submissions I will pick 5 randomly, to get access to a discount code, saving you $75 off the $200 entry fee.</p>  <p>Now for the rules. Bribery won’t work, so you don’t have to say you are most excited about seeing <a href="https://www.stlouisdayofdotnet.com/SpeakerDetail.aspx?SpeakerID=46" target="_blank">my sessions</a> at the event next week (though you can definitely choose those).</p>  <p>Hope to see you in St. Louis!
