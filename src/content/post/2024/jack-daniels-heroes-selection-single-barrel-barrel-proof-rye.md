The Jack Daniel's Heroes Selection is a limited-edition whiskey series honoring military personnel. Each year, a veteran selects a unique barrel for release. The 2024 edition, chosen by U.S. Navy Veteran Melvin Keebler, features a Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye Whiskey with a mash bill of 70% rye, 18% corn, and 12% malted barley. Bottled at 125-140 proof, it offers rich caramel and toasted oak flavors with complex spices.
