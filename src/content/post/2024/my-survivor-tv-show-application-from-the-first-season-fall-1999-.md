<p>I hoard things, lots of things, especially digital things.</p>  <p>Apparently back in the fall of 1999 I decided to start filling out the application form for the CBS TV Show called Survivor, which was prepping for it&#39;s first season which ended up airing in May 2000.</p>  <p>I found this in a word document entitled &quot;Survivor.doc&quot; on my computer while playing around with NVIDIA&#39;s ChatRTX application.</p>  <p>Some funny things inside of this document.</p>  <p>1) I was still a student down at Rolla.</p>  <p>2) I mentioned my &quot;long term girlfriend&quot; and &quot;probably be engaged by January&quot; which is hilarious to me based on how that relationship went.</p>  <p>3) I had both a phone (cell) and pager number listed, along with a Fax number, which must of been a web based service because I have no idea where that area code is from.</p>  <p>4) I apparently never filled out the entire application or sent it in :D&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="/Portals/0/ch_survivor_1999.pdf">Take a look at the PDF</a>, you can see some of the &quot;rules&quot; and requirements for the application process, as well as the answers I filled out.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>
