excerpt: "In prep for my riding of the Dirty Kanza 100 coming up in June, I've been trying to get some miles in, and looking for some gravel that is &ldquo;near by&rdquo; to get some gravel miles in as well. Last week I was talking with my neighbor, who tends to ride his bike(s) a little, he mentioned the Femme Osage Trail, but I wasn't able to head out with him on Saturday afternoon. Sunday morning I decided I would try to map out that route based on what he said, and started looking on GravelMap.com."
