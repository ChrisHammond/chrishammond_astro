excerpt: "In our last blog post we covered the first in the Holiday Select series, in this one, we cover the second, the Holiday Select 2012 Limited Edition bottle from Jack Daniel’s. The bottle comes in a black box, but unlike 2011 this box isn’t a clamshell opening. The bottle and an insert slide out the top of the box. The back of the box reads:THIS JACK DANIEL’S LIMITED EDITION IS FROM BARRELS WE USED TO CRAFT OUR HOLIDAY BARREL TREE. FOR 2012, OUR MASTER DISTILLER, JEFF ARNETT, HAS SELECTED BARRELS WITH A LIGHT OAK CHARACTER, ALLOWING THE SOFTWARE NOTES OF VANILLA AND CARAMEL TO SHINE THROUGH. WE HOPE IT BRINGS A SPECIAL QUALITY TO YOUR HOLIDAY SEASON.The shape of the bottle is the same as the 2011 bottle, but the labelling has some gold instead of all white. The holly berry leaves are also in green, instead of the white as in 2011. Also differing from the 2011 bottle, the text on the back of the bottle now matches the text on the back of the box. The 2012 bottle is 45.2% Alcohol, or 90.4 Proof, down from 100 the year before. Finding this one online appears a little more difficult, I found one on ebay listed at $165 as of December 5, 2018. Release: December 2012Proof: 90.4Size: 750ml "
