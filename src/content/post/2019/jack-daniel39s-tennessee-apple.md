<![CDATA[<p>With the release of Jack Honey and Fire over the past 10 years, it was time for Jack Daniel’s to catch the apple train and release their own Tennessee Apple Liqueur. I was able to get some here in Missouri earlier this fall from <a href="https://lukasliquorstl.com/" target="_blank">lukasliquorstl.com</a>.</p><p>The 750ml bottle comes in the usual Jack Daniel’s shape with a green gold and white label. The front of the bottle reads:</p><blockquote><p>Jack Daniel’s </p><p>Original Recipe</p><p>Tennessee Apple</p><p>Finely Crafted</p><p>Apple Liqueur Blended with Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey</p><p>35% ALC. By Vol. (70 Proof)</p></blockquote><p>One side of the bottle reads:</p><blockquote><p>Smooth Flavor</p><p>Tennessee Apple has the distinct character of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey coupled with crisp green apple for a fresh &amp; rewarding taste.</p><p>Enjoy Chilled</p><p>Caramel Colored </p></blockquote><p>The other side reads:</p><blockquote><p>Jack Daniel’s Character</p><p>Lynchburg, Tenn</p><p>Classic Green Apple</p><p>Crisp &amp; Fresh</p><p>Exceptionally Smooth</p><p>Highest Quality</p></blockquote><p>The back reads:</p><blockquote><p>Distilled &amp; Bottled by Jack Daniel Distillery Lynchburg, Tenn USA</p></blockquote><p>The bottle can be found at retailers everywhere, and as I understand it, is around for a while, so it shouldn’t be too hard to track down.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Release</strong>: 2019<br /><strong>Proof</strong>: 70<br /><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml<br /><strong>Price:</strong> $22.99</p> ]]> <a href="https://collectorofjack.com/TennesseeApple">Read More at collectorofjack.com</a>
