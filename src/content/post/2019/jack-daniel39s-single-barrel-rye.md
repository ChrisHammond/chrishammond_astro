In 2016 Jack Daniel’s released the Single Barrel Rye, a 94 proof Tennessee Rye Whiskey. Depending on where you acquired it, it may or may not have come with a box. The front of the box is adorned with:“Jack Daniel’s Uniquely Crafted / Handmade BarrelsSingle Barrel RyeTennessee Rye Whiskey” The side of the box reads:“Single Barrel RyeHand SelectedJack Daniel DistilleryLynchburg, Tenn.”Towards the top of the rear box, the same graphic that adorns the front is found, below that you find:“Single Barrel Tennessee Rye Whiskey draws its wonderful flavor from a unique 70% rye grain bill, matured to perfection in our handmade oak barrels, positioned in the upper reached of our barrelhouses. Bottled at 94$, this is a big bold rye that does not overpower. Complex flavors of ripe fruit mingle with light toasted oak notes, allowing the rye grain to shine through, creating a taste rich with spice and a pleasant lingering finish. Enjoy this Single Barrel Rye neat, on the rocks, or in classic rye cocktails.”Inside the box you will find a bottled in the current Single Barrel form.
