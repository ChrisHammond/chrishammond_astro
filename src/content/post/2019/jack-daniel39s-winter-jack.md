The front has the same text, Jack Daniel’s Winter Jack, Original Recipe Tennessee Cider. Along with:A seasonal blend of apple cider liqueur &amp; Jack Daniel’s Tennessee WhiskeyThis bottle has a very similar label to the bottle released in 2013, but this time around has a lighter colored (more grey than black) snow scene, with more gold accents around the label. The neck of the bottle, unlike the 2013 release, has a red white and gold label.The side of the bottle reads slightly different than the 2013 release:Jack Daniel’s Winter Jack is a seasonal blend made perfect with our apple cider liqueur, Jack Daniel’s Old No.7 Tennessee Whiskey. An original recipe from Jack’s home, Lynchburg Tennessee.The rear of the bottle reads:Jack Daniel’s Winter Jack Tennessee Cider “Best Served Warm”There is something special about every season in Lynchburg.
