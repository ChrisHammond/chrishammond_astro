<p>In 2016 Jack Daniel’s celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Jack Daniel’s Distillery in Lynchburg, TN. They commemorated this with a special edition bottle in a black and gold label.</p><p>The front of the bottle reads:</p><blockquote><p>Jack Daniel’s </p><p>1866 150th 2016</p><p>Anniversary of the Jack Daniel Distillery</p><p>A Special 86 Proof Old No.7</p><p>Tennessee Whiskey</p><p>Distilled &amp; Bottled By</p><p>Jack Daniel Distillery</p><p>Lynchburg, Tennessee, USA</p><p>43% Alc By Vol. (86 Proof)</p></blockquote><p>The right side of the bottle reads:</p><blockquote><p>This Special Eight-six Proof Old No.7 Is a Tribute to a Legacy of Whiskey Craftsmanship &amp; The Birthplace of an American Classic</p></blockquote><p>The left side reads:</p><blockquote><p>The year 2016 Marks 150 Years of Jack Daniel Distillery The Oldest Registered Distillery in The United States of America</p></blockquote><p>I don’t believe the bottle was limited in release, and was likely available in all 50 states. I haven’t seen one on a shelf in quite a few years however. You can find it online for around $130.</p><p><strong>Release</strong>: 2016<br /><strong>Proof</strong>: 86<br /><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml<br /><strong>Price:</strong> $24.99</p>  <a href="https://collectorofjack.com/Distillery150thAnniversary">Read More at collectorofjack.com</a>
