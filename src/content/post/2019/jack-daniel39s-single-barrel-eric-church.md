<p>As part of Eric Church's Double Down US Tour Jack Daniels teamed up with the country artist for a limited edition single barrel bottle. The bottle appears to be a pretty standard single barrel bottle, ours was bottled on 12/19/2018, it came with a hang metal Eric Church Chief tag with JD Limited Edition on the back of the tag (see photos below).</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The bottle came with/in a somewhat custom single barrel box. The front reads with the normal single barrel select branding, but has a black silhouette of the bottle with a rendering of the Eric Church / Chief tag.</p>  <p>The back of the box reads:</p>  <blockquote> <p>Music and friendships were always important to Mr. Jack. That's why we are proud to offer this limited edition Jack Daniel's Single Barrel package celebrating our longstanding relationship with Eric Church. Not only is Eric a Friend of Jack, but he shared Jack Daniel's spirit of community. In honor of that spirit we are making a donation in support of the &ldquo;Chief Cares Fund,&rdquo; a non-profit created by Eric and his wife, Katherine in 2013 to impact lives around the globe and in our own neighborhoods.</p> </blockquote>  <p>You can still find the bottle online at some retailers.</p>  <p><strong>Release</strong>: 2019<br /> <strong>Proof</strong>: 94<br /> <strong>Size</strong>: 750ml<br /> <strong>Price:</strong> $65+</p>  <a href="https://collectorofjack.com/JackDanielsEricChurch">Read More at collectorofjack.com</a>
