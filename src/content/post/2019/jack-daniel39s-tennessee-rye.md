<p>In September of 2017 Jack Daniel’s released their standard bottle of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Rye, their 70% rash mash bill. This is a more affordable version of the Rye from Jack Daniel’s than the <a href="https://collectorofjack.com/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye" target="_blank">Single Barrel Rye</a> released in 2016. </p><p>The bottle is your standard square bottle from Jack Daniel’s, though the label has a tan background with black writing and green highlights. The front of the bottle reads:</p><blockquote><p align="center">Jack Daniel’s <br /><br />Barrel Aged <br />Rye<br />Moore CO.<br /><br />Tennessee <br />Straight <br />Rye Whiskey<br /><br />Distilled &amp; Bottled By<br />Jack Daniel Distillery<br />Lynchburg, Tenn USA<br />45% ALC.Vol. (90 Proof)</p><p align="center">Every Drop made in Lynchburg Tennessee<br />Quality and craftsmanship since 1866</p></blockquote><p>The side of the bottle reads:</p><blockquote><p>Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Rye brings together two classics – rye’s distinctive flavor, drawn from our unique 70% rye grain bill, and Jack’s time-honored charcoal mellowing method. What emerges is a spicy whiskey that’s sippin’ smooth. <br />Jeff Arnett<br />Master Distiller<br />”Every day we make it, we’ll make it the best we can”</p></blockquote><p>The back adds:</p><blockquote><p align="center">Made only in <br />Lynchburg<br />Tennessee<br />U.S.A.</p></blockquote><p>While the other side reads:</p><blockquote><p align="center">Rye Grain<br />Hand Selected / Imparting a full<br />and spicy character<br /><br />Mellowed<br />For smoothness / Drop by drop through<br />Sugar Maple Charcoal<br /><br />Matured<br />For characters / In our own<br />Handcrafted Barrels</p></blockquote><p>Pictured in the photos here are both a 750ml and 1L bottle, only really differing in size and spacing of the content on the labels. These bottles can be found worldwide.</p><p><strong>Release</strong>: 2017<br /><strong>Proof</strong>: 90<br /><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml/1L<br /><strong>Price:</strong> $23/33<p><br /><br /></p>  <a href="https://collectorofjack.com/JackDanielsTennesseeRye">Read More at collectorofjack.com</a>
