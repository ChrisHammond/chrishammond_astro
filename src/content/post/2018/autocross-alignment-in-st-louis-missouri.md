excerpt: "With the parts installed on the car, it was time to get wheels and tires mounted/balanced and installed. I also needed to get an alignment on the car as I knew it wasn't close to the autocross specs that Tire Rack had in their recommendations. So I took my car to the only place I trust for an autocross alignment in Missouri, Solo Performance Specialties.  The tires mounted up nice and easy on the Konig Ampliforms, after I got the wheels with the right bolt pattern of course. They were mounted onto the car and it was up on to the alignment rack next.
