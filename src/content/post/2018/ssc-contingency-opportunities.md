<p>So one of the ways to help supplement the cost of autocross at a National level with the SCCA is to participate in their contingency programs. There are a variety of contingency options available, depending on:</p>  <ul>  <li>What make of car you drive</li>  <li>What class you run in</li>  <li>What tires you run</li>  <li>What programs you register for</li> </ul>  <p>You should check out the <a href="https://www.scca.com/pages/solo-contingency" target="_blank">SCCA Autocross Contingency page</a> to see which options are available to you, and which will work for your particular class/car.</p>  <p>What's the catch with contingencies? Well, you typically (almost always) have to run your vehicle with the sponsors decals on the vehicle.</p>  <p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-footer="true" data-header="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/39900291410/in/dateposted/" title="Spec FR-S Decked Out"><img alt="Spec FR-S Decked Out" height="375" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/964/39900291410_b5302163bd.jpg" width="500" /></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>  <a href="https://www.specfrs.com/ssc-contingency-opportunities">Read More at www.specfrs.com</a>
