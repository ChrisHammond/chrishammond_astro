In my previous blog post I talked about the Tennessee Tastersâ€™ High Angelâ€™s Share Barrels, in this post I cover the second release in the series, Hickory Smoked. The bottle is labelled as "Tennessee Whiskey Finish with Charred Hickory Staves". 

<blockquote><strong>Smoked Hickory Finish</strong> â€“ a fully matured whiskey finished with charred hickory staves for a smoky flavor at 100-proof, just in time for the 30<sup>th</sup> annual Jack Danielâ€™s World Championship Invitational BBQ which is held in Lynchburg on Oct. 27. Selected by Master Taster Marsha Hale and available late-October.

This selection was from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marsha-hale-82543b37/" target="_blank">master taster Marsha Hale</a>, whom according to her Linked In profile has worked at Jack Danielâ€™s for almost 31 years. 

I have yet to decide if I will try these bottles myself. I do have two of each, with the original intention of keeping one and having the other for trading to fill my collection with missing items. If however I could come across some other bottles, I would likely try one out myself, only time will tell if that happens.
