<p>Sitting in the basement tonight, getting ready to movie night, the family started yelling &ldquo;Hey Google, Turn off the basement lights&rdquo;. To our dismay, Google was unable to turn off the lights.</p>    <p>I noticed a few days ago that the front light didn't appear to be working, wasn't turning on/off on schedule, I turned it on manually one evening, and the next afternoon it was still going.</p>    <p>I rebooted my Insteon Hub, or so I thought. I thought even after doing so, I was able to get the lights to work via an app, but apparently I was mistaken.</p>    <p>Our Insteon Hub has died. Apparently this is a very common problem, <a href="https://forum.insteon.com/forum/main-category/insteon-products/insteon-hub/94559-insteon-hub-not-powering-on" target="_blank">according to this thread</a>.&nbsp; So I ordered the recommended capacitor (C7, a 47uf 50v), and this weekend I'll be working on repairing the Hub to see if I can avoid having to buy a new device. I will tell you, if I can't repair this one, I won't be buying another Insteon Hub.</p>
