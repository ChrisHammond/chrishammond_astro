<P>I spent 20+ hours over the last 3 days upgrading the mapping system for SCCAForums.com. The map was getting awful cluttered once I imported all of the track data that we were provided.</P> <P>You can now filter the map results based on program type (Solo, Club, Track and Other), as well as by class within each of those program types. Check out the map to see it in action! <A href="https://sccaforums.com/maps/">https://sccaforums.com/maps/</A></P> <P>posted from <A href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</A></P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
