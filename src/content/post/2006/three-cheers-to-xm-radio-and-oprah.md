<P><A href="https://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P144534.asp">XM Radio signed Oprah Winfrey</A> to a 3 year deal worth 55 Million dollars. That's awesome, not that I will ever listen to Oprah, but that is a great move for XM Radio. Down with the Sirius and that dumbass Howard Stern!</P> <P>Long live XM Radio!</P>
