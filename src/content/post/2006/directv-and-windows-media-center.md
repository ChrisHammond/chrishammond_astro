<P>At CES yesterday Microsoft announced they've made a partnership with Directv and their Windows Media Center platform. I hope this turns out to be an awesome arrangement, as I currently subscribe to Directv and their HD service, and currently Windows Media Center lacks HD capabilities except of off the air broadcasts.</P> <P>I realize it'll be a while before this all comes to be, but it should be an amazing platform once integration occurs!</P>
