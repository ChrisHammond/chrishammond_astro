excerpt: "The first Cone Clinic was held today at the first day of the Walnut Ridge national tour. A great thanks goes out to the Hollis' for instructing all of the drivers today. We each got 12 runs, had a blast and a great time getting the rust out from almost 6 months off! We start at 9am tomorrow. As last year, the town has welcomed everyone with open arms! All of the local businesses have the posters up for the event, and it seems to be once again the hot topic of the town! We're off to dinner, hope to have a great time tomorrow! I'll try to post tomorrow night with an update. posted from..."
