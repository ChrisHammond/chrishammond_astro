<p>Well, my 2003 350Z Enthusiast model is officially paid off. It is also no longer my car!</p><p>My buddy Jasyn &quot;Dozzle&quot; Randazzo took a train from Kansas City to St. Louis last night and drove the car home today. </p><p>I talked to Dozzle this afternoon, he made it back to KC and was out and about showing the car off to friends.</p><p>Have fun with her Dozzle! She&#39;s a good ride! Now that the 350Z is gone I hope to spend more time on the 240Z to get that going soon.</p> posted from <a href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</a>
