Alright, my good buddy Dozzle is purchasing the car! Dozzle, otherwise known as Jason (sp?), is one of my fraternity brothers who lives in Kansas City. Dozzle is getting two extra sets of wheels, 1 set of shocks, and a few other goodies to get his Stock class autocross career kickstarted. Thanks again Dozzle! I've got a week left on the car till Dozzle picks it up.
