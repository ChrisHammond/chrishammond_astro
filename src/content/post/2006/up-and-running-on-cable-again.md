<P>Charter is scheduled to come out tomorrow to "reconnect" the cable. Hopefully they call first, as I don't need them to come out anymore. I hooked up the cable modem and got everything provisioned tonight (should have started before 1:15am though). </P> <P>I'm not paying any "installation" fees for this baby!</P>
