<P>Well, the honeymoon is almost over! It's about 10:30 CST and I need to get back to the room to wake Natalie up so we can begin packing. We've gotta be at the lobby at 5:40am to catch a ride to the airport.</P> <P>The Paradisus at Playa Conchal was excellent! We'll do a more detailed review along with photos a few days after we get back. We've got a few thousand photos to go through.</P>
