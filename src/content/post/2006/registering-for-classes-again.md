At lunch I ran up to UMSL to get reenrolled for classes. On 11/20 I should be able to register for classes. Luckily nothing has changed since the last time I took classes at UMSL, I don't have to retake any classes, I was worried that credits would expire or something, I guess that's just a nasty rumor!
