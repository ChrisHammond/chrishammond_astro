<P>Today we went on an ATV/Canopy tour with Hightide Surfshop. It was a blast! Our guide Randall was excellent. We had a great time on the ATV ride, and then riding 8 different Zip lines. Though I had some issues going upside down! I was upside down, as intended, but only hung one arm down and held onto the ropes with my other arm, Natalie ended up hanging both arms down.</P> <P>If you're ever in Tamarindo check them out at <A href="https://www.tamarindoadventures.net/" target=_blank>TamarindoAdventures.net</A>.</P> <P><A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/316859332/"><IMG height=139 alt="" src="https://www.horsesandcars.comhttps://static.flickr.com/109/316859332_7fcee287f4_m.jpg" width=240></A>Â <BR><A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/316859331/"><IMG height=153 alt="" src="https://www.horsesandcars.comhttps://static.flickr.com/118/316859331_8c5d6a5c11_m.jpg" width=240></A></P> <P>After the ATV/Canopy tour we took two jetskis out into the ocean for an hour. My hands have never been so tired! With all the motorsports today they are worn out!</P> <P>Tomorrow we're off to do a Volcano/Hotsprings/Rainforest tour. It'll be a long day but hopefully worth it!</P>
