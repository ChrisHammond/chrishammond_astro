<P>The above topic covers two different thoughts..</P> <P>I have the power. Chad complained this morning because his once obscure site has now been indexed by google. That's right, I have the power!</P> <P>The other reason for the post. This morning I got a new Microsoft Natural Keyboard (4000). When I arrived at work I took off my fleece jacket and reached for my mouse. I immediatly felt a large shock, and after about an hour of diagnosis I figured out that I managed to fry the mouse with that shock. Great, now I have to go buy a new mouse!</P>
