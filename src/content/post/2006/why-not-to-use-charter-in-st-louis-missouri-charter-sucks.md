excerpt: "I&#39;ve had no luck with Charter and Directv Customer service over the past month.Here&#39;s a letter I sent to Charter this morning via their website.&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;d like to know how Charter is going to make me a happy customer. Here&#39;s my story.During the storms in July I lost my Directv service. They were unable to come out and restore my service in a timely manner, totally missing an appointment. I called charter, was told I could get a DVR, Digital Cable, and HD service installed at my house the following week, all for a good low price based on the fact that I was leaving Directv.Fast forward three weeks, that&#39;s today. So far all I have is a digital cable box, no HD and no DVR, and a $350 bill from charter. When the technician came to install the DVR and Cable box he showed up without either piece of equipment and told me I would have to go to charter&#39;s offices myself. I went there, and was told I couldn&#39;t get the DVR. That $350 bill includes charges for the DVR, cable service, and $100 of installation charges. I was told when I signed up my installation would be waived due to me switching from Directv.I&#39;d love for someone from Charter to call me and schedule an appointment for my DVR to be DELIVERED and INSTALLED. I tried picking it up myself two weeks ago and was told I couldn&#39;t as it had to be professionaly installed. Then, last week I was told they were out of stock in STL, though when I ordered they were in stock.I&#39;m extremely unhappy with the level of service I&#39;ve received thus far, and if these matters are not corrected, all the promised equipment installed and working by Friday the 18th of August I&#39;ll be cancelling ALL my services with Charter and going to SBC and Dish networks.Unhappily,Chris..."
