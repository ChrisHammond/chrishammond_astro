<p>The more and more I use gmail the more I get pissed off at this feature. Whenever I go there, the darn window pops up in front of all my other windows. I like to load gmail up and go on to something else, coming back to Gmail when I&#39;m ready.</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to keep Gmail from making itself the top window when it loads? This is most annoying in Vista. Please help!</p> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
