excerpt: "I don&#39;t care what anyone says about the Spam Rules engine in Community Server. It may work partially, but it sure isn&#39;t great. I got nearly 200 spam messages yesterday on ChrisHammond.com, and I&#39;d estimate 1500 over the past 7 days.That&#39;s 1500 freaking spam messages about Dale Earnhardt, used cell phones, Bahamas beach clubs and who knows what other topics. I have all the CS spam rules implemented, including the Akismet rules as well, yet I still get spam messages coming through. Community Server may filter the spam into probable and likely, but that&#39;s not good enough for me anymore. I want spam stopped before it gets there. So, in an attempt to thwart the deluge of spam I&#39;ve implemented&nbsp;captcha control. I hope that this allows me to simple block the spam posts from getting entered at all, rather than just filtering them into seperate buckets.I&#39;ll post later this week with an update on how things are going.... Down with the spam! Posted from..."
