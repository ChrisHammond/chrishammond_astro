<P>I've been here in Lexington, Kentucky for the past 4 days. I was fortunate enough to meet two of the brightest minds in the industry! Also, I can't forget <A href="https://www.chadhobson.com/" target=_blank>Chad Hobson</A>&nbsp;(checkout that killer site, what mad skillz).</P> <P>Anyways, back to the brightest minds. I got to meet Shaun Walker, founder of DotNetNuke, and Scott Willhite, one of the Board members for DotNetNuke. I of course got them to sign my DotNetNuke book while they were here!</P><A href="/photos/january_kentucky_trip/picture13525.aspx"><IMG src="/photos/january_kentucky_trip/images/13525/thumb.aspx" border=0></A>
