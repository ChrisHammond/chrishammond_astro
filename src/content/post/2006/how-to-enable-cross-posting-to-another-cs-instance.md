<P>If you're looking to enable cross posting to another install of CommunityServer that supports it, you can setup your blog to cross post all of your postings to that other instance.</P> <P>Here's how.</P> <P>Go to your Dashboard here on weblogs.asp.net. Click on the global settings navigation on the left.</P> <P>Click on Spam, Ping and Cross-Posting <BR>Under the "Blogs that will be cross-posted to " heading click on "Setup a new blog"</P> <P>Add the URL which should be of the format</P> <P><A href="https://otherdomainname.com/blogs/metablog.ashx">https://otherdomainname.com/blogs/metablog.ashx</A></P> <P>Add your APPKey, which is most likely your path after the /blogs/ directory for your other blog, for example, weblogs.asp.net/christoc/ my appkey would be christoc.</P> <P>put in your username, password, and any message you'd like added onto the bottom of your message. I add a "Posted from Such and Such URL" to all my cross posts.
