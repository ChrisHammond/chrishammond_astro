<P>Well I ended up in an RX8 today. Eric Jones asked me to run in BS today as they lost 3 drivers and weren't going to make a class.</P> <P>So far, damn this car is different. I'm far from a smooth speed maintaining driver. I miss my torque!!!! In 4th, out of 5. Hope to move up this afternoon.</P> posted from <a href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</a>
