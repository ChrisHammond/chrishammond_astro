<P>We were at lunch today at JBuck's in the West County mall here in St. Louis. We had a nice lunch, I'd never been to JBuck's before, I was definitely underdressed in jeans and a DotNetNuke t-shirt.</P> <P>After Rich paid the bill we were sitting there drinking our Sodas talking business and noticed a big party was leaving. At least I thought it was a big party. The waiter came up to us and told us they were evacuating the restaurant because they had a bomb threat! </P> <P>If only we hadn't paid the bill yet I wonder if we woulda gotten a free lunch out of it?</P>
