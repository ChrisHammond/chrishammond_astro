<p>Earlier this week I posted a quick rant about the new <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/archive/2006/11/14/Zune-not-for-vista_2100_.aspx" title="Zune and Vista">MS Zune not working on Vista</a>.</p>  <p>Someone posted a comment on <a href="https://chrishammond.com" target="_blank" title="Chris Hammond">another one of my blogs</a> that they are working on getting <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/tabid/54/itemid/648/zune-not-for-vista" target="_blank">Zune/Vista compatibility fixed by next week</a>. I sure hope so! If that&#39;s the case I&#39;ll be installing Vista on my Laptop before we <a href="https://www.horsesandcars.com" target="_blank" title="Horsesandcars.com">head off to get married</a>.</p>  <p>Is this just another nasty internet rumor? Possibly, but I know the source, and they have a few more MS connections that I do!</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Posted from <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a></p>
