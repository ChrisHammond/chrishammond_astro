<P>I know I've been slow to post here lately! I'm finally processing the photos from opening day at Fenway.</P> <P>What else have I been up to? <A href="https://bikerszone.com/photos/christoc/Test_drove_a_VRSCR_today.aspx">Looking at Harleys</A>, though I've decided that REALLY isn't a good option right now. Though, unfortunately tonight I may have been talked into an interesting project. More on that later this week.....</P>
