excerpt: "My sophomore year of high school at Maconaquah High School I got to perform in a band. We were called The Flying Gimps, and we performed a whole two times that year. Maconaquah had a talent show every year called Pow Wow. Derrick Smallwood, one of the other members of the band got me a copy of Pow Wow 1993, and I&#39;ve gone ahead and ripped the video to a WMV file. I&#39;ve got two files, linked below. The first one is the original footage of The Flying Gimps performing Helmet&#39;s Unsung, the audio on this is horrible, but it&#39;s the original recording, I&#39;m going to have to say the lack of quality is due to the positioning of the camera in front of the bass player&#39;s amp/speakers. https://christoc.com/video/TheFlyingGimps-Unsung-93.wmv 18.4mb The second video is what we should have sounded like! I&#39;ve dubbed in the song from Helmet over the video. https://christoc.com/video/TheFlyingGimps-UnsungDubb-93.wmv&nbsp;19mb UPDATE: The original video is also on YouTube, though it seems to have some playback issues [YouTube:KToXKKVQ07M] "
