<P>For those of you currently stuck in Missouri or elsewhere in the country with terrible weather, it's scheduled to be 75 degrees and sunny here on Saturday! (knock on wood)</P> <P>Hopefully Marty and Bill will make it from MO tomorrow afternoon, Marty and Kate were supposed to fly out today but got stuck due to the weather back home.</P>
