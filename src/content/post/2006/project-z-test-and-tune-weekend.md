<P>I got a few details from Andy on his way back from the test and tune he took the car to this weekend at Grissom.</P> <P>I'll try to do a full writeup later in the week, but the basics of what all has changed include.</P> <P>Hawk HPS pads up front instead of HP+, which apparently solves our Ice Mode problems.</P> <P>Run a full tank of gas, instead of completely empty, to help solve some of the corner exit tire spin issues we've been fighting for over a year.</P> <P>A very special thanks to Sam Strano from <A href="https://www.stranoparts.com">www.stranoparts.com</A> for driving to Indiana to help Andy get the car squared away!</P> posted from <a href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</a>
