<P>Hope everyone has a great 2006!</P> <P>I'm going to make a resolution this year, the first time I've actually made one.</P> <P>Go on a diet, okay, I know everyone makes that resolution, but I'm going to do it a bit differently. More information to come, but by my wedding date I WILL&nbsp;weigh what I weighed in high school. </P>
