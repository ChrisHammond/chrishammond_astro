<p>I got back from Nashville this evening. I took a flight&nbsp;down there Monday night to&nbsp;provide a couple of days of <a href="https://www.engagesoftware.net/Services/DotNetNukeDevelopment/tabid/403/Default.aspx" target="_blank">DotNetNuke training</a> to one of our new clients down there. Overall it was a great trip. The client is great, staff was a blast, we had fun, and hopefully they learned a bit too! Tennessee is such a beautiful state. I love travelling down there.</p><p>The more training I do with DotNetNuke the more I enjoy it.
