<P>Since I was up here in Maine, I figured I'd shoot my old friend Dustin Price an email. Dustin and I went to school together in Riverside from 6th to 9th grade before I moved to Indiana the summer after freshman year. </P> <P>He lives down in Dover New Hampshire so I took a drive down there last evening after finishing up with the day's training class. We played poker for a few too many hours then snapped these photos. I say a few too many hours because I was winning till about halfway through, then my game fell apart!</P> <P>See you in April Dustin.</P> <TABLE class="" cellSpacing=0 width="100%"> <TBODY> <TR vAlign=top> <TD class=""> <P><A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/292104953/" mce_href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/292104953/"><IMG height=160 alt="" src="https://static.flickr.com/120/292104953_6ddd4583ee_m.jpg" width=240 mce_src="https://static.flickr.com/120/292104953_6ddd4583ee_m.jpg"></A></P> <P class=Photo><A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/292104947/" mce_href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/292104947/"><IMG height=160 alt="" src="https://static.flickr.com/122/292104947_0ea70aa5c3_m.jpg" width=240 mce_src="https://static.flickr.com/122/292104947_0ea70aa5c3_m.jpg"></A></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
