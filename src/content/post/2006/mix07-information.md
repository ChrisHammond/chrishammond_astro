<P>Does anyone know anything about Mix07 coming up in April? I'm curious who one would contact about session information. I tried using an email address from the <A href="https://www.mix07.com/">www.mix07.com</A> site but of course it gets returned. Anyone at MS have any contacts they can forward my way? I'd apprecaite the help.</P> <P>&nbsp;Chris Hammond</P>Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/" mce_href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</A>
