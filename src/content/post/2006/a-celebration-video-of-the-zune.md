excerpt: "In celebration of the Zune now working on Windows Vista I put together&nbsp;a little video last night. I actually filmed this back on November 14th, the day I got my Zune, I just hadn't taken the time to do anything with the video until last night while I was waiting for my Zune to fully Sync with Vista. I originally was going to edit the video and remove my hand from any shots, but after spending a half hour doing so in Windows Movie Maker last night I gave up and just time compressed the original video.
