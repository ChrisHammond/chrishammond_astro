<P>I just wanted to make a quick post to try and guide anyone in St. Louis who may be looking for Highspeed internet service.</P> <P>DON'T go with SBC DSL! I would&nbsp; highly recommend going with Charter's Pipeline service. Though Charter is more expensive there is no contract, and from my experience dealing with Charter's support is a lot less painful than dealing with SBC. Also, their service works better and has better uptime!</P> <P>So, take it from a pro who has been burned. SBC DSL sucks! :D </P>
