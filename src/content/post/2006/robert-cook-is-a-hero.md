<p>Over the past weekend, we lost a brother of Lambda Chi Alpha. Robert Cook of Rolla, Missouri, was tragically killed in a plane crash in Sullivan, Missouri.</p>  <h3>A Hero Remembered</h3>  <p>In the aftermath of the crash, one of the survivor&#39;s fathers called Robert a hero, attributing his actions to saving his daughter&#39;s life. Robert&#39;s bravery and quick thinking in such a dire situation exemplify the true spirit of a Lambda Chi Alpha brother.</p>  <h3>Honoring Robert</h3>  <p>Robert, thank you. We&#39;ll miss you dearly. Your courage and selflessness will always be remembered by those whose lives you touched.</p>  <p>For more information about Robert and to read tributes from his brothers and friends, please visit our fraternity site at <a href="http://www.alphadeltazeta.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_new">www.alphadeltazeta.org</a>.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>
