<p>Everything I ever learned in school must be a lie! I was always taught there were 9 planets in our Solar System, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/08/24/pluto.ap/index.html">now there are only 8</a>! </p><p>Lies lies lies, next someone will tell me that 1+1 is not equal to 2!!! Oh the horror.</p>
