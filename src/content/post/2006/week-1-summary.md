excerpt: "So, as of this morning I&#39;ve been on this diet for a full week. In that week I went from 265lbs to 257.5lbs, a drop of 7.5lbs. Not a bad start, if I can keep up this pace I&#39;ll reach my goal of 200lbs around the second week in October. I don&#39;t expect to keep up with 7.5lbs a week, but it would be very cool if I could! A quick summary of what I had to eat all week? Mostly Turkey/Lorraine Swiss sandwiches, bowls of cereal, and a few salads here and there. Definitely not the healthiest of diets, but much healthier than I normally eat. This week my goal is to step up my exercise level. Here&#39;s to another 7.5lbs! Posted from..."
