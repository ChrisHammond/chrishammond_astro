<P>If you're looking for some good Mexican food, DON'T go to Zapatas on Manchester Road!</P> <P>We, the office, went there the day they opened, for lunch, to give them a shot. The food was horrible, no one enjoyed their meals. I figured, maybe, just maybe, that was just a bad day to go, the first day a place is open.</P> <P>So, a month later, I tried it again last night. We went there for dinner. It was STILL HORRIBLE. The food is just very low quality, high prices and&nbsp;the chips both times tasted burnt.</P> <P>So, if you are looking for a restaurant on Manchester road for some good Mexican, I suggest trying one of the other places. Senor Pique's (sp?) down near Sulpher Springs Road is a good start, I've eaten there twice in the past two weeks and it's been great food and service both times.</P> <P>Don't eat at Zapata's, trust me!</P>
