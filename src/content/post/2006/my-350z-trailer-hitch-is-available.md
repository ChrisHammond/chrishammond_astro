<p>Well, it's not really "mine", but the company who developed the hitch I use on my car is now selling them to other folks.</p> <p>https://www.tuxedoparkracing.com/350zhitch.html&nbsp;(no longer available)</p> <p>If you've got any questions please feel free to ask, I'll try to answer any that I can.</p> <p>I've towed my 6x8 trailer with this for well over a year now. Even hauled THREE sets of wheels/tires down to Walnut Ridge Arkansas earlier this year. I generally take two sets, tools, chair, cooler, bike, etc on the 6x8. I've hauled some weight with this thing.</p> <p>We've even taken the time to remove the hitch for events, though most of the time I just leave it on the car and run with the extra weight in the back.</p> <strong>UPDATE JANUARY 2011</strong><br /> <a href="https://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/490/350z-Trailer-Hitch-Take-2.aspx">While the Tuxedo Park Hitch is no longer available I have a new blog post regarding trailer hitches for the Nissan 350z.</a>
