<P>Well, it looks like I'm going to have to upgrade the site sooner than I thought. I just deleted 100+ comment spam posts from some jackass posting a link to his article. Luckily they weren't approved yet so no one else saw them, but it's a pain the ass for me to have to delete them all. </P> <P>The next software upgrade with have some better controls to make sure it's actually someone entering a comment, and not an automated script.</P>
