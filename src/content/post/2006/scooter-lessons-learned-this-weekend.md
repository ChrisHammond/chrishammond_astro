excerpt: "Here's a few lessons I wish I had learned a few months ago, could have saved me two fires, and many hours tearing apart a scooter for no reason. 1. To start a scooter with the ignition button you must be holding the front brake down. 2. Some scooters won't start if they're on the kickstand. I tore apart the switches on my scooter trying to get the damn starter working, only to learn that the reason I couldn't get the starter to run was that I wasn't holding down the brake lever.  Now that I know this tracking down the other issues on the scooter will hopefully be easier. I don't think I'm getting any spark, but at least i know the rest of the electrical system seems to be in order now. posted from..."
