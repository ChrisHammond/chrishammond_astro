excerpt: "Just over a week and a half ago I installed Windows Vista Ultimate RC1 on the newest of my desktop machines. Overall it&#39;s been a pleasurable experience, unlike some of the other DotNetNuke core team members have had! So far Vista has worked out well with me for&nbsp;VS 2005, I even got a&nbsp;release out for DnnCart.com last week that was completely written on this VISTA box.&nbsp;I did realize a few things though. I NEEDED to get more RAM. Trying to run Photoshop and VIsual Studio 2k5, as well as a few RDP windows was very taxing on the box. The machine is a Dell, Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.80GHz dual core, RADEON X300/X550 Series (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM), 149gig SATA drive. It had 768mb of RAM on it (a mix of 3200 and 4200. With those stats my Windows Experience Index has a base score of 2.0. The limiting number being the Graphics card. Here&#39;s a shot of my score&nbsp;This evening I installed 2 gigs of DDR2 4200 RAM, and so far it&nbsp;is flying! Hopefully tomorrow I&#39;ll be installing a nVidia GeForce 7900GS 256MB PCI-E x16 Video Card that I got off of www.Woot.com a few weeks back, this weekend I also ordered a Seagate 250GB SATA Hard Drive refurb off of woot. I&#39;ve gotta pick up a DVI to VGA converter tomorrow so I can use the car, my 19&quot; VGA just won&#39;t fit into the DVI plug! I ordered two off Tiger Direct last week, but of course I ordered the wrong ones. I figure once I install this new card my score should go up quite a bit! We&#39;ll see how it goes.After I get the score up I&#39;ll have to look into getting another monitor up here as well, I&#39;m itching to try my hand in a dual screen setup, though two 19&quot; CRTs will sure take up a lot of deskspace!
