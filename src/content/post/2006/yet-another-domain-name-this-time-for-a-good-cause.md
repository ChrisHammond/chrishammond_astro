<P>So what could it be that made me purchase yet another domain name? </P> <P>My wedding! Well, that actually made me purchase two.</P> <P>The first one being <A href="https://www.horsesandcars.com/">HorsesandCars.com</A>, which I purchased a few weeks back.</P> <P>The second one however, I purchased and setup yesterday. For the wedding my goal is to weight 200lbs, what I did when football started senior year of high school. So, to reach that goal I need to drop 65lbs, yesterday morning I stepped on the scale at 265. So, what's the new domain name? <A href="https://65lbs.com/">https://65lbs.com</A> keep track as I track EVERYTHING I eat, all the exercise I do, and my daily weight loss (hopefully not gain).</P> <P>Oh, and as of this morning I had 63.5 to go!</P> posted from <a href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</a>
