<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/229212058/">The new ride is now rolling on 20s!</a> Why you might ask? Because they were a great deal at the time of purchase. I have these wheels and the stock set of wheels/tires to put back on when the weather turns for the worse.</p>  <p>Between the 5 cars in the driveway/garage there are 20 wheels and tires on the ground, that&#39;s in addition to the 12 extra wheels for the 350Z all with tires on them, plus the 7 extra tires for the 350Z and 4 wheels/tires for Tahoe.</p>  <p>That makes for a total 36 wheels and 43 tires in my household. Add 2 more to each of those if you count the wheels/tires for the Scooter!</p>  <p><img height="333" src="https://static.flickr.com/82/229212058_10d89d4b46.jpg?v=0" width="500" /> posted from <a href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</a></p>
