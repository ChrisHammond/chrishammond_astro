<P>Well I finally, after two days of trying to tell UMSL that I already met with an advisor, got my classes for Spring 07 scheduled. I'm signed up for two Economics classes on Mondays and Wednesday evenings.</P> <P>$1600 bill for those, not to mention whatever books will cost me, and the oh so wonderful UMSL parking stickers.</P>
