<p>Yesterday afternoon a few of my fraternity brothers and I took a roadtrip down to Rolla. We had to go give&nbsp;one of our <a href="https://www.alphadeltazeta.org/" target="_blank">fraternity</a> brothers&nbsp;our best, and have a few beers with him. Mike is headed to Iraq on Friday morning to work there for 4 months training soldiers on a new weapons system. Best of luck to you Mike, give them hell and have a safe trip, we&#39;ll be drinking with you when you get back.</p>
