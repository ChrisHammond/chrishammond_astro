<P>Bill Gates' webcast is still on for his Keynote at CES in Las Vegas today.</P> <P>So far they're just discussing Windows Vista, which I expected. I read a rumor online that they may announce an HD-DVD upgrade for 360s, it looks like that was just a rumor.</P> <P>Sure I'm excited about Vista, but who really cares until it's available? I try a beta on a test machine sometime in the next few weeks, but honestly, I'm a what can you give me now kind of tech guy.</P> <P>Hmmm, they made some sort of preview of MS Flight Sim, but of course my SBC DSL dropped the connection during that outage.</P> <P>update: looks like Bill just announced the new Treo Smartphone is selling tomorrow. I don't know if that was announced previously.</P> <P>update2: Awesome news! Directv and MS partnership! Media center is going to rock once you have Directv access as well!</P> <P>update3: Xbox360 update coming shortly!</P> <P>update4: third manufacturering partner announced for the 360.</P> <P>update 5: external HD DVD announced for xbox 360</P>
