<P>I've done some communityserver development in the past, but never anything with the CSmodules architecture.</P> <P>I was looking around for some good examples tonight and didn't come across too much along the lines of a CSModule that actually does something, until I came <A href="https://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2005/09/23/Auto_Name_Your_CS_Posts.aspx">across this post from ScottW.</A> I'll hopefully work with it this weekend, in between working on <A href="https://solo2.org/blogs/christoc/archive/2006/06/02/Motor_pulling_fun.aspx">pulling motors</A>.</P> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
