I had hoped to get more updates on the site tonight, but after our softball game was cancelled we came home to a dark house. We've got some power, just not enough to actually do anything. The laptop battery is alive, but we're on a neighbor's wireless signal. Some of the lights come on, but not enough to do much but cast dark shadows. I guess there's power in the grid, but not enough to power the houses on our side of the street! More updates tomorrow.
