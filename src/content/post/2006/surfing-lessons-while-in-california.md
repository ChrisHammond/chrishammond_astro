<P><A href="https://www.horsesandcars.com/">Natalie and I</A> are headed to California tomorrow to finish up some wedding planning. I'm hoping while I'm out there I'll get to take a surfing lesson.</P> <P>Even though we lived on an island in the Pacific ocean for 2 years, I've never once touched a surf board. About the closest thing was body boards back when we were little. It'll be interesting to see if I can find a place for a lesson, and then see if I can have a little fun with it!</P> <P>Stay tuned next week for an update on my surfing experience!</P>
