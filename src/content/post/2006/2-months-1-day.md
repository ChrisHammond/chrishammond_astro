<P>We're now just over 2 months away from our wedding. December 2nd is fast approaching! </P> <P>We have spent the past two weekends getting registered at a few places. I'll be putting up our Registry information here in the next day or two. We're also getting our list together again to send out the invitations!</P> <P>The whole Save The Date card/survey thing didn't go over too well. We only had 20 or so responses, if that, though I believe there were some server problems that I was unaware of at the time making it hard for people to fill out the survey.</P> <P>More coming soon!</P>
