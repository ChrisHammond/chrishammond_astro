I finally got SBC to cancel my 1 yr DSL commitment due to all the troubles I've had with my connection. Charter is coming out Thursday to hook us up on pipeline! The only helpful person I talked to at SBC was the guy who cancelled the commitment. Everyone else I spoke with today, from Jack in India, to some girl here in the states, wouldn't help me for anything. My DSL dropped around 11am this morning and never did come back up. Great work SBC, AT&amp;T, whatever you want to be called.
