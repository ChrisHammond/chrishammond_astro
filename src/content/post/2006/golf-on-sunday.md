<p>Well, it looks like I&#39;ll be out on the links on Sunday. I haven&#39;t played a full round of golf in probably 6 years now, so it&#39;ll be an interesting time. I&#39;ve been to the range twice this week, and hopefully I&#39;ll be there again this evening to try to continue to get the rust off.</p><p>We&#39;ll be playing at the <a href="https://www.landingsatspirit.com/">Landings</a> down in Chesterfield Valley Sunday morning.</p>
