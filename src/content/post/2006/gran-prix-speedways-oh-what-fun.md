<P>Well, I got to do another preview for GPS tonight. All I can say is, wow, wow, wow.</P> <P>We got a 5 minute session, with 4 drivers total. I started in the back, Natalie quickly got out of the way because I guess I was annoying her always getting on the inside at each corner. I then caught up to the two leaders, made the pass on 2nd and was inside on Turn One, only to have the guy plow me into the wall. I threw my hands up, he didn't even know what he did was wrong, he later told me he made a good move.</P> <P>3 Turns later I watched him take out the girl who was in front in a hairpin, plowing them both into the outside wall, I passed as the yellow came out which turned into a red flag. From there I was in the lead. They lined us up for the start again, in the position I stopped for the red flag, the guy behind me had no chance, I put a good 40 feet on him before we finished, 2-3 laps later.</P> <P>I took my Oakley driving shoes tonight, left the helmet in the car. I think I'll have to sell one of my 3 layer driving suits and get myself a cheap single layer so I can wear that instead of their provided gear.</P> <P>I can't wait for this place to open!!!!</P> posted from <a href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</a>
