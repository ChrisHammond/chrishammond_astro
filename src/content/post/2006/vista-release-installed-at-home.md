<p>Well, I spent most of the day today doing a few things around the house. First, I took the good wheels off the Tahoe and put the stock wheels and tires back on. I figured that with Winter upon us I'd rather leave the shiney wheels down in the basement.</p> <p>While I was changing the wheels I had Vista installing on my machine again. I used the same machine that I had RC1/RC2 installed on, but this time I started over, as I had done with RC1, but not RC2. I installed Vista fresh on this machine.</p> <p>Everything is great so far. I installed Office Pro, Live Messenger, and a few other things. One of those other items is Windows Live Writer. I hadn't tried it out before (yes, I know, I'm behind). This is my first post with it, I'm not yet sure how I feel about it, but we'll see. Hope this post works, otherwise I may never try it again.</p> <p>As for the Vista machine, I've made the switch, I imported my 1.1gig PST file over to this machine, and setup most of my email accounts on it, so I'll be using this machine for all my email, development now.</p> <p>What's left? To get <a title="Zune working with Vista" href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/archive/2006/11/17/zune-to-work-on-vista-next-week.aspx" target="_blank" rel="past post">ZUNE working with Vista</a>, then I'll be all set! Once that happens I'll also install Vista on my laptop, the 64bit version of course.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:1243bb29-f9a1-4a87-b677-17aa77ac65fe" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="https://technorati.com/tags/Vista" rel="tag">Vista</a>, <a href="https://technorati.com/tags/Zune" rel="tag">Zune</a>, <a href="https://technorati.com/tags/Office" rel="tag">Office</a>, <a href="https://technorati.com/tags/Cars" rel="tag">Cars</a></div> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
