<p>Incase anyone missed the emails from Admin earlier, the deluge of spam notifications that went out earlier was due to a backlog of emails from 3-4 days. Here&#39;s a copy of the email</p><p>&quot;All,</p><p>The email job did not successfully run for approximately 3-4 days so you may have just received a large amount of comment notifications, etc. (of which undoubtedly some will be for SPAM comments). This IS NOT an increase in SPAM. In fact, we put new rules in place as a result of the recent SPAM and now auto-delete approximately 99% of the incoming SPAM.</p><p>Before deleting SPAM, please forward an example (assuming you get multiple) to <a href="mailto:aspblogs@telligent.com" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">aspblogs@telligent.com</a>.</p><p>Regards,</p><p><a href="https://asp.net/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">ASP.NET</a> Weblogs Team&nbsp;&quot;</p> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
