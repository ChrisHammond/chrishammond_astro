<P>Well, we made it back to St. Louis without any major issues. Overall the honeymoon was great! I'll try to get more photos and details up over the next few days. Just wanted to make a post that we were finally home.</P> <P>I'm still uploading <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157594406920951/" target=_blank>photos from the wedding</A> to my <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond" target=_blank>Flickr account</A>, they should all finally be there by morning! If you want to order prints from flickr, please register on flickr.com and then add me as a friend/contact/family, then you'll be able to see the order prints links. I've got the photos setup so that only friends/family/contacts can see the print links. Otherwise you can just click on the "All Sizes" link above the photo when viewing a specific photo and choose to save the largest image on your computer. You can then take that file to a printer of your choice to have hard copies made. Questions? Email me</P>
