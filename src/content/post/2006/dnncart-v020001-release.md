<p>What&#39;s that? DnnCart has a release? Impossible! <a href="https://www.dnncart.com/Blogs/tabid/25/EntryID/9/Default.aspx" target="_blank">You can read more about the release here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#39;s some text from the blog post describing what I&#39;m attempting. </p><p>&quot;You may be asking, what is the point of this release, there isn&#39;t much included? This is just the beginning as I develop the next version of DnnCart. I have big plans for DnnCart, and have had big plans for the past three years. I finally decided it was time to start, and rather than tackling it all at once, I&#39;d start small, build pieces and try to do small quick release cycles. </p><p>Do you want to contribute? Feel free to do so! You can take the code I&#39;ve packaged up on the downloads page and add it into your Portal/Solution.</p><p>This module is written in C# using Visual Studio 2005 for DotNetNuke 4.3.5, feel free to add on to the source code, make changes, add features, improvements, etc. I&#39;d love to see the changes you make, perhaps they can be added back into the module for others to download.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://www.dnncart.com/">www.dnncart.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
