I&#39;ll continue to post them when I have the time to do so.</p><p>While I was off meeting with a client DotNetNuke dropped a new release! <a href="https://dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank" title="DotNetNuke">Go out and get it</a>!</p><p>If you&#39;re running any of the recent releases 3.3.* or 4.3.* it&#39;s highly recommended you upgrade to 4.3.4, there were some security issues found and resolved with those releases.</p><p>More DotNetNuke Tips next week.</p> Posted from <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
