<p>It went up on Ebay Today for $14500. I owe 14537 or something, so I&#39;ll take a $40 loss on the car to get rid of it.</p><p>I&#39;ll miss it. It&#39;s been a GREAT car. Here&#39;s to hoping I get the 240Z finished! If I can get it done before May of next year&nbsp;I&#39;ll get $50 from Seelig, that&#39;ll cover my $40 loss.</p> posted from <a href="https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</a>
