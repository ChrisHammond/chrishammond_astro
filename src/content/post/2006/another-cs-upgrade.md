<P>Well, the time has finally come! Weblogs.asp.net has been upgraded to CommunityServer.</P> <P>My first blog was <A href="/christoc">https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc</A> and now that the site is upgraded to CS I can post from there and have it cross posted in multiple places, so I'll be able to blog on weblogs.asp.net and have it posted over to <A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/">https://www.chrishammond.com/</a>, which will hopefully get me doing more technical blog posts like I used to attempt ;)</P> Posted from <A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/blogs/metablog.ashx">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>
