We performed a slight reorganization of the forums this evening. We removed a couple of inactive forums, combined some of the smaller forums and moved around&nbsp;some of the focused topic discussions. There's now a <A href="https://sccaforums.com/forums/default.aspx?GroupID=8">SOLO / Autocross</A> specific forum for all SOLO discussions, rather than just class discussions, and the same goes for the <A href="https://sccaforums.com/forums/default.aspx?GroupID=9">Club Racing</A> forums. posted from https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/
