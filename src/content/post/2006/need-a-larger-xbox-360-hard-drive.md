<P>I was just wondering myself when there will be a larger Hard Drive for the Xbox 360, the current 20gb version is pathetic, especially considering my Zune has 30gb!&nbsp; (At least the Xbox 360 works with Windows Vista)</P> <P>I found a few rumors floating around that perhaps a larger drive is in the works.</P> <P>"At a recent Microsoft event to promote upcoming games and the <A href="https://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4845">new Video-On-Demand service</A>,&nbsp;a retail <A href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rhoran/291246264/in/set-72157594364544798/">Xbox 360 unit was shown with an 80GB hard drive installed</A>. While it's 20GB short of the <A href="https://dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4623">previously rumoured 100GB hard drive</A>, it still offers a fourfold increase in storage capacity for users to download their new content onto. As with the stock 20GB hard drive, a portion will be allocated for system use. Nevertheless, the photo shown is purportedly of a stock Xbox 360 with an upgraded drive.<BR><BR>More detailed space requirements for the new Video-On-Demand&nbsp;service have come to light as well.&nbsp;A 44-minute TV episode weighs in at approximately 550MB in&nbsp;480p widescreen and just under 2GB in 720p format. Movies are much larger with a two-hour movie reaching 1.7GB for a 480p version and 6GB for the 720p version. Although the Xbox 360 <A href="https://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4756">recently gained the ability to output 1080p</A>, no content has been offered yet at this resolution.<BR><BR>Also being shown off was the HD-DVD drive in its retail packaging and in action." <A class="" href="https://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4857" target=_blank mce_href="https://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4857">Daily Tech</A></P>
