excerpt: "DotNetNuke Daily Tip for 6/30/2006 Ever need to make skin file changes and you don&#39;t want to go through the process of repackaging your ZIP file and uploading the file to your site? Here&#39;s a quick way to make skin file changes without having to go through the package and upload process. If you develop your skins with the HTML files you can edit the HTML files on the server, they should be located in the /portals/##PORTALID##/skins/##SKINNAME##/ folder. You can directly edit the HTML files. Once you&#39;ve made these changes go to the admin/skins menu and reparse your skin package. If you develop your skins using the ASCX file method any changes you make to the ASCX files will be made immediately to the skins on your site so you don&#39;t have to reparse the skin package.
