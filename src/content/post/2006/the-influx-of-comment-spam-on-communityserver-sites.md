<p>Has anyone else had a HUGE influx of comment spam on your CS sites lately? (I'm assuming quite a few folks are seeing this)</p>  <p>Over on <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/">chrishammond.com</a>&nbsp;(upgraded to 2.1 a few days ago)&nbsp;I've been getting close to 100 spam messages a day. While it's nice to have the CS 2.1 spam filtering running over there, I'm curious if anyone has looked into where it's all coming from???</p>  <p>Posted from <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a></p>
