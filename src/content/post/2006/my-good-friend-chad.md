Well, as you may have seen in my previous post, my good buddy Chad Hobson was razzed a little about his lame website, <A href="https://www.chadhobson.com">www.chadhobson.com</A>. His response to my razzing was to throw up a little picture, and make a few text changes. Though he's still yet to provide anything functional on his website, he has called me a god, to which I am flattered.
