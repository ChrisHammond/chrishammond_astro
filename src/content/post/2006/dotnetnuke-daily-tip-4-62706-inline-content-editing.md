<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/archive/tags/daily+tips/default.aspx"><strong>Check out all of the DotNetNuke Daily Tips from Chris Hammond.</strong></a></p>  <p><strong>DotNetNuke Daily Tip for 6/27/2006 </strong></p>  <p>This is a quick tip as I was out of town for a while and haven&#39;t had a chance to catch back up yet.</p>  <p>Did you know with DotNetNuke 4.3 you can now edit content in place on your website? What&#39;s that you say? You didn&#39;t know this?</p>  <p>Well that&#39;s right, you can change module titles within your DotNetNuke pages, and have been able to do that&nbsp;for a few versions with DNN4. BUT, something new to DotNetNuke 4.3, the Text/HTML module includes this functionality as well. You can edit text within the Text/HTML modules without having to go to the edit screen, and also save these changes by clicking elsewhere on the site.</p>  <p>Stay tuned for&nbsp;another <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/tags?tags=daily+tips">dotnetnuke Daily Tip</a> coming tomorrow!</p>
