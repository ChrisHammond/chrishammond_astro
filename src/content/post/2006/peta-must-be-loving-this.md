<P>I'm not a huge fan of PETA and their opinions, but <A href="https://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/08/mouse.fire.ap/index.html">this story</A> will probably be a big battle win.</P> <P>Summary, an 81 year old man found a mouse in his home. He was burning leaves out side, so he put the mouse in the leaves to dispose of him. The mouse ran back in the house, on fire, and set the house ablaze.</P>
