<p>Yesterday evening we, along with a couple hundred thousand other folks, headed down to Forest Park to see the &quot;Glow&quot;, part of the Great Forest Park Balloon Race. I&#39;ve posted some of the photos in one of my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157594287247860/" target="_blank">Flickr sets</a>.</p>
