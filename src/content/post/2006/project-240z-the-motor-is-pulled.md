<P>Well, it's been just over two months since I picked up the Project 240Z from Krekeler. Today I successfully pulled the motor and transmission from the car. </P> <P>It took me a few hours today, in some of the hottest weather of the year. If you watch in the video below you'll see I aim the fan at me whenever I move around the car :)</P> <P>Also in the video, you may not notice, but before the motor comes all the way out of the car the front end of the car gets lowered. I had intended to lower this manually when I was ready, but the car decided it was ready to be lowered while I was pulling on the motor. Luckily I wasn't near the car, and I left the wheels/tires on it so the car just slipped off the front jack stands and onto the ground. It worked out perfectly, dropped the car down just enough to everything free and clear.</P> <P>Enough banter, here's the video!</P><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKmMYhwZrMU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKmMYhwZrMU</A>  <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>posted from <A href="https://sccaforums.com/blogs/christoc/">https://SCCAForums.com/blogs/christoc/</A></P>
