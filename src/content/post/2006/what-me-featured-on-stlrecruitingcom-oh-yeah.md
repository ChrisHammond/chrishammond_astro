<p>Many thanks to Jim over at www.stlrecruiting.com, yesterday he called me up for a quick interview and today he posts an article about me!</p>  <p>If you&#39;re looking for my Technical posts, check out my blog at <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/</a>. Just heads up though, for any posts you find that may seem odd ;), I use my blogs to do a lot of SEO work, so some posts may not seem to fit, but they all have a purpose!</p>   <p>Links removed 2024</p>
