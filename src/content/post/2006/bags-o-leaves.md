<P>We spent the morning cleaning up all the leaves in the front yard. 5 hours, and 28 bags later the front yard and gutters are cleaned up.</P> <P>The gutters were nice and full of crap. It's amazing how quickly leaves will degrage in a wet gutter environment. At least now they're all cleaned out for the winter.</P> <P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
