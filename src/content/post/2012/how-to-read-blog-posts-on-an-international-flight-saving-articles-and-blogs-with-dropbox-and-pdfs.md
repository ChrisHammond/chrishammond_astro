<p>So this is totally unrelated to <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a>, as most of my posts tend to be, except that I am getting ready to travel for an extended trip overseas and I was wondering how could I take some blog posts and articles that I found online that I want to read, with me on the plane trip.</p>  <p>The problem with my flight being that I will be going overseas which pretty much rules out inflight internet (at least on United, which I have decided booking the flight on was a bad idea, but it is booked).</p>  <p>So how can I take some articles from websites with me, without having internet, and without killing trees? Well my Android tablet of course (I assume this would also work on an IPad, but no guarantees). Using my tablet, along with <a href="https://db.tt/7Jda7qEl" target="_blank">DropBox</a>, and then of course a PDF reader (Amazon Kindle works) I can read articles that I’ve saved.</p>  <p>First things first, find the article you want to read, I won’t link to any, for fear of the authors/publishers getting upset about this process, but I found some from a magazine that you might read Outside. Find the article, then go to the Print view from the article (not all websites will have a print view, this one doesn’t, but that is okay). Go to Print the article, but instead of printing to paper, choose your PDF printer option. What? You don’t have a print to PDF option? Well go download the <a href="https://www.cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp" target="_blank">CutePDF Writer utility</a>, it is free.</p>  <p align="left">You need to print the article, choose the PDF option, and then SAVE the PDF somewhere, here is where <a href="https://db.tt/7Jda7qEl" target="_blank">DropBox</a> comes in handy. I saved the articles I wanted to read to my local <a href="https://db.tt/7Jda7qEl" target="_blank">DropBox</a> folder, into a folder called reading. These are saved locally onto my PC, but using dropbox they can be sync’d across multiple computers and even devices.</p>  <p align="left">Now, to ensure you have them offline, meaning you can read them on your tablet while travelling, without internet access, be sure to go to the <a href="https://db.tt/7Jda7qEl" target="_blank">DropBox</a> application on your tablet (or phone), find your Reading folder, and for each file in that folder be sure to mark it as a Favorite. This will ensure that the files are available offline, during your flight.</p>  <p align="left"><a href="https://db.tt/7Jda7qEl" target="_blank">Haven’t signed up for DropBox yet? That’s okay, I have a nice URL here you can use to register</a>. It is free up to something like 2gb, and if you’re taking more than 2gb of PDFs with you you are going to have enough reading for a few trips around the globe I would assume.</p>  <h2 align="left">Steps for saving Articles to PDF and reading on your tablet, via <a href="https://db.tt/7Jda7qEl" target="_blank">DropBox</a>.</h2>  <ol>   <li>     <div align="left">Find the Article online</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Print the article to PDF using CutePDF Writer</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Save the file to your local <a href="https://db.tt/7Jda7qEl" target="_blank">DropBox folder</a></div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Install <a href="https://db.tt/7Jda7qEl" target="_blank">DropBox</a> on your phone/tablet</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Find your Reading folder on your device</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Favorite the PDF files so that they are available offline</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Open PDF using your favorite viewer</div>   </li> </ol>
