This is by no means a complex project, and most of it is code from the public domain for projects based on the original Netduino.</p>  <h2 align="left">Project Overview</h2>  <p>So what does the project do? Essentially it plays 3 “tunes” that are predefined in the code. The tunes and most of the code for the project are <a href="https://forums.netduino.com/index.php?/topic/831-music-with-a-piezo-speaker/" target="_blank">based on this thread on Netduino.com</a>. </p>  <p>The primary method for interacting with a Piezo Buzzer module is pretty simple, you just need the following three lines.</p>  <p>PiezoBuzzer Pb1 = new PiezoBuzzer(GoSockets.Socket1);   <br />Pb1.SetFrequency(####);    <br />Thread.Sleep(####);</p>  <p>Socket1 would be the location where you have the module plugged in to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA20PG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007PA20PG" target="_blank">Netduino Go</a>. The ### for SetFrequency is a float, 440.00 should be an A where the note C would be 261.63.Duration is an integer in milliseconds, so 1000 would be 1 second. Basically once you set the frequency you tell the program to sleep for 1 second to let the note play out.</p>  <p>The code in the project is a little more complex than that, providing octaves of notes and their frequencies, as well as the ability to pass in an array of notes and tempo to adjust for speed/duration.</p>  <p><a href="https://christocnetduino.codeplex.com/releases/view/90828" target="_blank">Download the code</a></p>  <p>But enough of that, how about a video of it in action?</p>  <p><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SaN0nIXT2Z8?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" width="480" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <h2>Other <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FRZ4E6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004FRZ4E6" target="_blank">Netduino Go</a> Projects</h2>  <p>Be sure to check out some of my other <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FRZ4E6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004FRZ4E6" target="_blank">Netduino</a> projects and blog posts.</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/blog/itemid/2545/building-a-netduino-tank">building a Netduino Tank</a> </li>    <li><a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/blog/itemid/2499/simple-netduino-go-tutorial-flashing-rgb-leds-with.aspx">Simple Netduino Go Tutorial Flashing RGB LEDs with a potentiometer</a> </li> </ul>
