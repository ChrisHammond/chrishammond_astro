<p>The Z06 is headed out to Wicked Stickers in St. Peters Missouri to get Tinted on Wednesday morning. If you&#39;re looking for window tint in the St. Louis or St. Charles areas be sure to stop by Wicked Stickers. They also tinted my 350Z a few years back, an awesome job and it held up without any issues whatsoever.</p>  <p>If you head out there, be sure to tell them CorvetteZ06.org sent you!</p>
