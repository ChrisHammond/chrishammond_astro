I ordered a pair of Corbeau A4s from <A href="https://www.soloperformance.com" target=_blank>SoloPerformance.com</a> today. Hopefully there here over the next few days! In the videos I posted the other day you can see me test fitting an A4 I borrowed from SPS in the car. Now I just need to fabricate some mounts for the brackets that I ordered as well!
