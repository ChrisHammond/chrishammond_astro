<p>How to break a Corvette in One Simple step? Leave your Microsoft Zune plugged in and &quot;playing&quot; music all weekend, in 32 degree weather (garage was probably 50's)</p> <p>I have a habit of just leaving my Zune on play when I get home, it's plugged into the car, so I figured no harm done, the Zune surely couldn't drain the car battery......</p> <p>Well this evening around 5:40pm I headed out to go to the mall and meet my wife for dinner (she'd be shopping ALL DAY LONG). I walk into the garage, unlock the car and walk around to the driver's side. When I get over to the door I hear something, like a fan or water pump running? WTF is that, the car isn't on, I thought to myself. I also then notice the parking lights on the front of the car flashing, and the interior lights seem to be as well. I open the car and get in, step on the brake to start the car and all the lights dim greatly. Oh great, the battery is dead.</p> <p>I try to start the car, click click click, yup dead battery. I open up the hood and I can hear relays going nuts up near the battery. I grab the battery that is in the garage from the 240Z and hook it up via jumper cables to the Z06, the relays stop, so that's good. I try to start the car, nothing, no dice, the battery doesn't have enough juice to jump it. I hooked the charger up to the car for a few minutes hoping it might start up, no luck there either, so Natalie came home and picked me up.</p> <p>After dinner we head out to the barn to get the F350 that has been parked there for the past few weeks. I figure with the impending winter I should have it at home and drive it whenever the weather isn't playing nice. After getting home I hooked the charger up to the car again and let it sit for an hour or so. I just ran downstairs and hooked it up, all is well once again, the Corvette started right up.</p>
