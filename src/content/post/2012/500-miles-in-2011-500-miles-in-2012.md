Well if that was good for a big guy like me, 2012 is going to be kickass! I hit 500 miles on the bike today for 2012, with 2 days left to spare in February.</p> <p>In January I did 256 miles, and for February I've done 245. Of those 501 miles I've climbed around 20930 feet, with 11,417 of that coming in February, and 3k of that coming on my <a href="https://app.strava.com/rides/4280953">ride up Tunitas Creek last weekend</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/23">Read More at www.bicycletips.com</a>
