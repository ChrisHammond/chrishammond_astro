<p>I am proud to announce that we have officially renamed Team Ride With Chris, to <strong><a href="https://laf.livestrong.org/site/TR?team_id=1581&amp;fr_id=1181&amp;pg=team" target="_blank">Team ITM America</a></strong>, for our ride at the Team LIVESTRONG Challenge Davis, this June 24th, in Davis, California. You can continue to donate to the individuals on the team <a href="https://laf.livestrong.org/site/TR?team_id=1581&amp;fr_id=1181&amp;pg=team" target="_blank">via the team page</a>.</p> <p>We have been looking for a new team name for a while now, and were approached by ITM Consulting out of Germany about helping to promote their new brand being launched in the United States later this summer, ITM America (<a href="https://www.itm-america.com">www.itm-america.com</a>)</p> <p>ITM has stepped up with a large donation to the team, and has currently put us into the top 20 teams in terms of fundraising for the LIVESTRONG Challenge Davis.</p> <p>I have known the folks at ITM for a couple of years now through the <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> ecosystem. They provide a wide array of IT services, including DNN integration with SAP and mobile solutions, custom module development and workflow implementations, and providing security assessments and risk abatement. </p> <p>Stay tuned for more information from ITM America on their website, <a href="https://www.itm-america.com">www.itm-america.com</a>, while they get things together over there you'll find a picture of Natalie and myself at a recent bike ride we did in Santa Rosa, California.</p> <p>As part of the agreement we will be sporting brand new &ldquo;kits&rdquo; for the ride in Davis.
