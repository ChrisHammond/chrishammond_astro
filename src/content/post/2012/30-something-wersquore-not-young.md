<p>This video kind of fits.</p>  <p>[YouTube:Mzian2rpVTQ]</p>  <p>Today I had my first eye exam in 15, probably more, years. It is time to get glasses. So. I have that going for me. </p>  <p>For those friends/family who haven’t heard yet. We have two announcements here for the blog (besides the whole glasses thing).</p>  <p>1) We’re having another baby! #2 is on the way in June 2013, no other details just yet.</p>  <p>2) We’re moving! Again. Go figure. We’re headed back to St. Louis, our lease starts on the first of December. We’ll hopefully get a 2012 Xmas card out right after Thanksgiving with the new address for everyone. If you need it before then, email me.</p>  <p><strong>Answers to a few questions:</strong></p>  <p>No, we don’t know if the baby will be a boy or a girl yet.</p>  <p>Yes, I will still be working for <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a>.</p>
