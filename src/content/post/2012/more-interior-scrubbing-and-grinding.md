<p>I spent some time this evening working on the interior of the car again. I went through one wire wheel and halfway through another on the passenger side of the car tonight.</p> <p>Tomorrow I'll be doing some final prep work, possibly laying some fiberglass (for the first time) and then later this week painting the floor.</p> <p>Photos and more later this week!</p>
