My bro Will Strohl has challenged me to a little fundraising for the Team LIVESTRONG Challenge in Davis coming up next month. He has stepped up, in addition to his previous donations to my ride, to donate $1 for every mile I ride a bicycle between today (May 22nd, 2012), and Sunday May 27th at 11:59PM. Why is he doing this? He knows I haven't been on a bike in over a week, so he figures it is probably a safe bet, and perhaps it is. Are you willing to do the same?  Will you donate $1 to my #LSCDavis ride, for every mile I ride by bike between now and 11:59pm PDT this Sunday?  If so, add your comment below to join the cause, I'll be sure to follow up with you via email to let you know how I do! I'll also update this blog post with details Starting Mileage: 0 miles    Current Mileage:&nbsp;106.1 miles     Total Raised: $106 Donations from:     Will Strohl $1/mile
