<p>My bro <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/tabid/825/BlogID/239/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Will Strohl</a> has challenged me to a little fundraising for the Team LIVESTRONG Challenge in Davis coming up next month.</p> <p>He has stepped up, in addition to his previous donations to my ride, to <strong>donate $1 for every mile I ride a bicycle between today (May 22nd, 2012), and Sunday May 27th at 11:59PM</strong>. Why is he doing this? He knows I haven't been on a bike in over a week, so he figures it is probably a safe bet, and perhaps it is.</p> <p>Are you willing to do the same? </p> <h2>Will you donate $1 to my #LSCDavis ride, for every mile I ride by bike between now and 11:59pm PDT this Sunday? </h2> <p>If so, add your comment below to join the cause, I'll be sure to follow up with you via email to let you know how I do! I'll also update this blog post with details</p> <p><strong>Starting Mileage:</strong> 0 miles   <br /> <strong>Current Mileage:</strong>&nbsp;106.1 miles    <br /> <strong>Total Raised: $106</strong></p> <p><strong>Donations from:    </strong><br /> Will Strohl $1/mile</p>
