excerpt: " Today is the day that Lance Armstrong packed up camp and went home. He has publicly announced that he is no longer going to battle with the USADA over the doping allegations.  I don't know if he doped, I assume he probably did, but the proof never came out to say that he did. I don't like the fact that he might have doped, but the more I get into the sport of cycling, the more I read (recently finished David Millar's book and am just wrapping up Slaying the Badger) the more I understand that cycling was all about doping."
