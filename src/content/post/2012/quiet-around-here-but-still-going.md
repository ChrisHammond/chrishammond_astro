<p>Things have been quiet around here, so I figured it was a good time for a status update that is longer than 140 characters.</p>  <p>We are in the middle of the process of planning our next move, true to our nature, we’ve been in Half Moon Bay for less than 18 months, and we’ll be heading back east. We’re going back to St. Louis in December, and currently looking for a place to live. I’ll be working from home and travelling back to San Mateo at least once a month to be in the office at DNNCorp.</p>  <p>The move and planning for such is taking up most of our time, though I am also travelling a lot for work lately, headed to Columbus next week and San Antonio after that.</p>  <p>Here’s a photo of Natalie and Jacqueline taken earlier this evening.</p>  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/8107560577/" title="Mommy and Jacqueline at Sunset by chrishammond, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8328/8107560577_3fed14ca5d_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Mommy and Jacqueline at Sunset"></a>
