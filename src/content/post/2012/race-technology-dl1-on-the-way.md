excerpt: "A huge thanks going out to Al Seim at Race-Technology.com, with his help we have a DL1 coming for the Corvette. There's a lot to do on the car here in the next few weeks before the Dixie National Tour in Georgia.  We'll get the DL1, Koni Shocks and hopefully the new swaybar installed next weekend, two weeks prior to the Dixie tour, that way if we run into any problems we'll have time to get them resolved. I'm also hoping to get the windows tinted next week."
