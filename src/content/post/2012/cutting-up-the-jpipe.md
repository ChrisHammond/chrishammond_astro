<p>I got some work done on the car, I think I figured out one of the biggest holdups I've had.</p> <p>The JPipe on my motor (the pipe from the Turbo to the Throttlebody) was mangled pretty bad, so much it wouldn't get a good seal on the throttlebody. Last night I cut about 4 inches out of it and bashed it with a rubber mallet for a while. I think I managed to get it where it will get a seat on the throttle body and still connect to the turbo. At least, hopefully a good enough seal the motor will run, after it runs the pipe will be tossed as it'll get replaced with an intercooler.</p> <p>After playing with the pipe for a while I finally got around to removing the wastegate cover, tonight I'll test fit the downpipe onto the turbo. Here are some photos from last night.</p> <p><a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511680556/in/pool-341731@N21"><img height="75" alt="Turbo to Throttle Body" border="0" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/221/511680556_c649864acc_m.jpg" /> </a><a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511708451/in/pool-341731@N21"><img height="75" alt="Throttle Body" border="0" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/511708451_78d3f96434_m.jpg" /> </a><a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511682036/in/pool-341731@N21"><img height="75" alt="take my photo I dare u" border="0" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/222/511682036_db0f403f6c_m.jpg" /> </a><a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511709595/in/pool-341731@N21"><img height="75" alt="My crooked back" border="0" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/511709595_b07e5ace6a_m.jpg" /> </a><a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511683454/in/pool-341731@N21"><img height="75" alt="Waste Gate Housing" border="0" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/197/511683454_f833b66842_m.jpg" /> </a><a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511684156/in/pool-341731@N21"><img height="75" alt="Waste Gate Housing" border="0" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/511684156_4fd127c770_m.jpg" /> </a><a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511711777/in/pool-341731@N21"><img height="75" alt="Waste Gate Housing" border="0" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/225/511711777_41c134103c_m.jpg" /> </a><a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511712479/in/pool-341731@N21"><img height="75" alt="Turbo" border="0" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/511712479_b7e7c4c596_m.jpg" /> </a><a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/511686158/in/pool-341731@N21"><img height="75" alt="Turbo" border="0" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/220/511686158_4201a02c4f_m.jpg" /></a></p>
