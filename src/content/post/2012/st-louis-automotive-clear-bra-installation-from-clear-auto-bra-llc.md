excerpt: "I picked up the Z06 from Clear Auto Bra LLC yesterday evening and I must say, I am highly impressed! The car looks amazing and in most light you can't even see the clear bra installed on the car.  Mark over at Clear Auto Bra LLC was more than helpful. I even had them run a custom piece down each side of the car to help protect it against the cones that are sure to hit the car in the coming year!"

<p>I picked up the Z06 from Clear Auto Bra LLC yesterday evening and I must say, I am highly impressed! The car looks amazing and in most light you can't even see the clear bra installed on the car.</p> <p>Mark over at Clear Auto Bra LLC was more than helpful. I even had them run a custom piece down each side of the car to help protect it against the cones that are sure to hit the car in the coming year!</p> <p>Thanks again to Mark at <a href="https://www.UltraShieldstl.com">www.UltraShieldstl.com</a>&nbsp;for the great service.</p> <p>Nick and I are headed off to Indy in the morning to pick up some rear tires, Hoosiers, so we can autocross this Sunday at the final St. Louis region event, the Index Challenge.</p> <p>We'll pick the tires up and then drive back home, get the wheels and other tires and head over to the shop to mount the recently acquired wheels and tires for the event. Plenty of video and pictures of our first event should be coming Sunday night or Monday.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a rel="tag" href="https://technorati.com/tag/corvette">corvette</a> <a rel="tag" href="https://technorati.com/tag/clear+bra">clear bra</a> <a rel="tag" href="https://technorati.com/tag/ppf">ppf</a> <a rel="tag" href="https://technorati.com/tag/st+louis">st. louis</a></p>
