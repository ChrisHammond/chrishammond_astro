<P>Current status: On hold</P> <P>Why? Mainly school. It's nearing the end of the semester and I'm trying to get some class work finished up. I have a large presentation on Monday evening, after that, Tuesday, I hope to start back up on the car.</P> <P>I'm picking up a replacement 240Z Gas tank on Sunday, instead of going with a fuel cell for now I'm hoping to get by with a stock 240Z tank.</P> <P>I ordered a Flux/Gas welder from Harbor Freight on Thursday. It's cheap, but will hopefully at least get me started. I can see how well I can learn, and hopefully repair/build a few things along the way. If I start to use it much (I don't foresee this) I'll look at getting a nicer model sometime.</P> <P>I started putting my&nbsp;new workbench together last night. I'll take some pics of it once it's finished (must install the&nbsp;tabletop still)&nbsp;and moved around in the garage. Right now it's in front of the car as I haven't made room for it on the wall yet.</P> <P>More next week!</P>
