<p>So what's going on with the 240Z? Not much. I haven't done any work since last week, though I plan to get some done tonight.</p> <p>I did manage to start putting together a <a href="https://www.project240z.com/Parts/tabid/59/Default.aspx">parts list of items I need to purchase</a>, it really starts to add up!</p>
