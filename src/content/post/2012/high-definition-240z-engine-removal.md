<p>I finally got the video working from my new camera. I installed Windows Vista again last night on my home Machine (after 4 months of running on XP again) and with Vista the camera works great!</p> <p>You can see/download the video with the URL below. But please right click and save the file, it is large. 180mb, but I think the quality is well worth the wait for the download.</p> <p><a href="https://www.christoc.com/p240z-6-16.2.wmv">https://www.christoc.com/p240z-6-16.2.wmv</a></p>
