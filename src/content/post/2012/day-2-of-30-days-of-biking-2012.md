<p>So Day 2 is the day I actually remembered about 30 Days of Biking, fortunately we managed to ride yesterday, for Day 1. Today I had to work. After work I came home and took Jacqueline out for a quick spin.</p> <p>Unfortunately the bike seat for the baby won't fit on my Cannondale CX, so I rode Natalie's bike around a bit. The baby loves it, she points, talks, and is downright happy when riding around on the bike.</p> <p>We didn't ride far, just around the neighborhood a few times to get 2 miles in, but we rode 2 more miles than I planned when I got up this morning!</p> <p>Here's the Strava data.</p> <iframe height="405" width="590" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" scrolling="no" src="https://app.strava.com/runs/6126708/embed/45a577f0b7b827c9a730df571095098ce60415c2"></iframe> <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/26">Read More at www.bicycletips.com</a>
