<p>So I came out after work today to head off to school to turn in a test, and what do I find? White stuff all over my car! And not all the white stuff that is pooring off our building as some crazy construction workers reface it, the cold whitestuff! Snow! I swear I checked the weather yesterday and I didn't see any snow anytime in the 10 day forecast.</p> <p>I guess I'll have to start checking it in the mornings!</p> <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2091447407/"><img height="180" alt="Suck snow" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2037/2091447407_ee101a8208_m.jpg" width="240" /></a></p>
