I hope to hit the junk yard on Friday and find a few more random Ford Ignition parts that I need for the megasquirt setup, and hopefully the megasquirt parts from DiyAutotune will be here early next week. My dad will be in town this coming weekend, so I plan to put him to work the next few weeks to help me get this car ready for April..."
