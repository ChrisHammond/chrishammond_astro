This year I said one of my goals is to ride in a century, a 100 mile bike ride. Iâ€™ve chosen the LIVESTRONG Challenge in Davis California on June 24, 2012.
  
As part of the ride I have set a goal to raise $1,000. You can donate to my campaign at (link removed)
  
<strong>All I am asking is that you donate $5 (more if you like) to the cause. Just $5 to help people around the world effected by Cancer.</strong> Below is more info on why I am riding in the LIVESTRONG Challenge this year.

##### My Story
I am riding the 105 mile distance at the 2012 Team LIVESTRONG Challenge Davis for four special people in my life, all affected by cancer. As part of the event I have set a goal of raising $1,000, I would appreciate any amount that you can donate to my cause, you can use the link on the left side of this page to (link removed).

##### Who am I riding for?

I am riding the #LSCDavis for four people, all affected by cancer. 
  
<strong><img style="display: inline; float: right" alt="My father and daughter" align="right" src="/assets/images/Philanthropy/LSCDavis12/Dad-October2011.jpg" />My father Bill </strong>was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer in August 2011, he had treatment for the cancer in November 2011 and we are hopeful that it was caught early enough to be eradicated by the treatment.

<strong>My uncle John, </strong>married to my father's sister, has been battling cancer for a number of years now.
  
<strong>My auntie Carol</strong> was diagnosed with breast cancer and successfully beat the disease.
  
<strong>One of my best friend's mother Janice</strong> was very recently diagnosed with breast cancer and is going through the treatment process now.
  
These close friends and family are my motivation for doing the LIVESTRONG Challenge in Davis this year. As of January of 2012 the longest bike ride I've ever done was 30.3 miles, that was in August 2011. If all goes as planned, I will surpass that total multiple times this year.
