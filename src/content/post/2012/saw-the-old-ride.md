excerpt: "I'm pretty sure I saw the Tahoe on my way to work this morning. Traffic looked like hell in California on 270 this morning so I went South on Lindberg to work. A Laguna Blue Tahoe was pulling into Chaminade when I drove by, with what looked like the same 20s I had on it, along with no license plate on the back so they probably had a temp tag in the rear window."
