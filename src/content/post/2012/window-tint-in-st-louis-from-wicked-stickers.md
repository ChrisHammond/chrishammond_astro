<p>This morning I had to head out to St. Peter&#39;s Missouri for a doctor&#39;s appointment, before the appointment I dropped the Z06 off at Wicked Stickers in St. Peters to get the windows tinted. As usual they did an excellent job! Wicked Stickers has tinted my 350Z and now the Z06, both looked great.</p>  <p><a class="image_link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2246365159/in/set-72157602395054879/" id="set_thumb_link_2246365159" title="35% Tint"><img alt="35% Tint" height="75" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2044/2246365159_6107caaf07_s.jpg" width="75" /></a><a class="image_link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2246362975/in/set-72157602395054879/" id="set_thumb_link_2246362975" title="Windows are Tinted"><img alt="Windows are Tinted" height="75" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2030/2246362975_87f3b03027_s.jpg" width="75" /></a></p>  <p>When I got back to the office I was happy to see my Hoosier tires showed up!</p>  <p><a class="image_link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2246191073/in/set-72157602395054879/" id="set_thumb_link_2246191073" title="Hoosier Autocross Tires"><img alt="Hoosier Autocross Tires" height="75" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2085/2246191073_0e6877ef88_s.jpg" width="75" /></a></p>  <p>The Koni shocks showed up yesterday.</p>  <p><a class="image_link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2246019274/in/set-72157602395054879/" id="set_thumb_link_2246019274" title="koni shocks"><img alt="koni shocks" height="75" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2287/2246019274_438d70c3f8_s.jpg" width="75" /></a></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>
