excerpt: "Exploring the journey of a Z06 Corvette reaching 12,000 miles and planning its winter rest while the F350 steps into action."

<p>The Z06 rolled over 12000 miles tonight. I parked it in the Garage with 12005 miles. It will probably remain on that number for a day or two as it looks like I might take the F350 to work tomorrow if the snow keeps up!</p>
