The Z06 rolled over 12000 miles tonight. I parked it in the Garage with 12005 miles. It will probably remain on that number for a day or two as it looks like I might take the F350 to work tomorrow if the snow keeps up!
excerpt: "Follow along as the Z06 hits 12000 miles and gets cozy in the garage. Stay tuned to see if the F350 takes on the snowy commute tomorrow!"
