<p>With a little effort this evening I was able to rearrange the garage enough to get the Z06 into the garage. I'm glad I can now park it inside at night, this morning when I got up it was covered with rain and leaves that had fallen last night.</p> <p>The garage isn't exactly clean, but I made room for the car. I need to start selling off parts for the 240Z so I can have the rest of my garage back.</p>
