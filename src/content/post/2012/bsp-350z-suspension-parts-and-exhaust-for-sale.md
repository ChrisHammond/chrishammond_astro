<p>Alright the time has come to part with the parts. I took some time this evening to take photographs of what I have and what I am trying to sell. Right now I am trying to sell everything locally so prices don’t include any shipping. If I don’t have any interest locally I’m willing to ship the coilovers/springs/shocks but only as a package. </p> <a href="https://www.autocrossblog.com/bsp-350z-suspension-parts-and-exhaust-for-sale">Read More at www.autocrossblog.com</a>
