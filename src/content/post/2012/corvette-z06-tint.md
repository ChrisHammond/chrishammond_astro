<p>Well it is about that time! I think I&#39;m going to have the Corvette windows tinted shortly after the holidays. I guess this time around I&#39;ll make sure to get a legal tint done on the car. The 350Z had illegal tint for over 2 years and I only got questioned about it once by a Rolla cop. It also didn&#39;t have a front license plate EVER in the 3+ years I owned it, and only got stopped once for that by a podunk Farmington highway patrol officer.</p>  <p>The Corvette didn&#39;t have a front plate for a week or two before I was kindly told by an officer that if I didn&#39;t put it on he would stop me the next time he saw me (that time he talked to me as I was leaving 7-11). So I figure the red Corvette is probably a little too much to push the window tint beyond legal, though I would really love to black out the windows like the 350z.</p>  <p>I&#39;ll post before and after pics if I go through with the tint soon.</p>
