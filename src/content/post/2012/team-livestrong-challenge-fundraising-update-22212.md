excerpt: "The following is an update email that went out to everyone who has donated to my LIVESTRONG fundraising. Wait, you haven’t donated yet? That’s okay, there is still time, head on over to my Philanthropy page and get started.  &lt;begin email&gt;  I wanted to send out a quick thank you to everyone who has donated to my ride for the 2012 Team LIVESTRONG Challenge in Davis. With your help I have already surpassed 50% of my initial goal for fundraising for the ride, I will likely be raising that goal to a larger amount here over the next few months, due in part to your very kind donations.  Year to date riding  I've been riding a lot here over the past couple of months as I try to get my body prepared for a 100 mile bike ride. I've been able to ride three, sometimes 4 days a week just about every week in 2012. In 2011 I rode around 580 miles total for the year, so far this year I am up to 458 miles, I should hit 500 before the end of the month, and if I keep this pace up (it will likely just increase) I should easily exceed 1000 miles before the Challenge on 6/24/2012.  Fundraising efforts  As part of my efforts to increase my fundraising for LIVESTRONG I have been making some changes to the Philanthropy page of my website (https://www.chrishammond.com/philanthropy.aspx) and have decided to include a list of everyone who has donated.  Your name in lights (get a link)  As an added bonus for donating, I am also adding a link with your name, pointing to the website of your choice (within reason of course). Please feel free to email me a link that you would like associated with your name on the Donor list and I will gladly add it to the site.  You've been ranked  On that Donor list I am currently listing of the donors in descending order of the donation amounts. If you are at the top, that's because you've donated the most. If you want to move to the top? Well, you could always donate more.  If you would rather not be included in that ranked list, or even included in the list of donors at all, please let me know and I will remove your name.  Tell a friend  Now that you've donated, perhaps you have a friend who might be interested in donating? If so, send them to the following website: https://www.chrishammond.com/philanthropy.aspx  Future emails  If you would rather not be included in future status emails please let me know, otherwise I will occasionally send out emails like this updating everyone on how things are progressing.  Once again, thank you for taking the time and effort to donate to the cause, no matter how little or big your donation is it is all greatly appreciated.  Chris Hammond "
