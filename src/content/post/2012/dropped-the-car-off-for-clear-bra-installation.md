<p>I dropped the Z06 off at Clear Auto Bra LLC this morning here in St. Louis. <a href="https://www.ultrashieldstl.com">www.ultrashieldstl.com</a></p> <p>I'm looking forward to seeing the results, and then enjoying those results for many years! Mark over there at CAB is covering the front of the car, and down the sides as well, you know, to protect it from all the cones! Thanks Mark!</p> <p>Saturday morning Nick and I will be heading to Indy and back. We're going to pickup a set of rear tires, we should have fronts and rears lined up and will be mounting them to the new wheels that Nick picked up yesterday.</p> <p>Sunday Sunday Sunday, the first event!</p>
