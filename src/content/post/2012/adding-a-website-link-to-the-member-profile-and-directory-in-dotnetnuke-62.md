excerpt: "In case you missed it, DotNetNuke 6.2 was released today, check out Will Morgenweck's blog post for more details on the release.  With some of the new features DotNetNuke 6.2 makes it easier to start to customize the listing of members on your site, and also the Profile display for users on the website. I started implementing DotNetNuke 6.2 on one of my racing websites last night (yeah, so I upgraded before the release happened, a benefit of working for the corp). In doing so I configured the profile pages on the website to use some of the new 6.2 functionality, before I show you the code, here's a link to my profile over there, so you can see what all I implemented. This is far from complete, plenty of more work to be done, but it provides far more information than the profiles did two days ago. "
