excerpt: "First things first. A HUGE HUGE HUGE thank you to every one of the individuals and companies that sponsored our fundraising for the event. Without your help Team ITM America wouldn't have raised $4,300 in total for LIVESTRONG. Also a big thank you for the largest donation from www.itm-america.com, they really helped us out with their donation and the KITs they outfitted us in!  And now for the details. All the build up, all the riding, all the fund raising, and here we are, three days past the event. I am not sore. Natalie is not sore. Did we really just ride 100 miles? Well no, actually, we didn't, we rode 95.8 miles, you can see the results on Strava right here.   "
