While I was in the Denver area I managed to rent a bike thanks to a friend (via twitter), and decided I wanted to go for a couple of long bike rides.</p>  <p>Throughout the week I spent time looking at Google Maps and Strava to try to figure out what route I was going to ride. I had already planned to meet up with Joel from <a href="https://www.reasons2ride.com">www.reasons2ride.com</a>, so I wanted to find a route that worked out well with a place to meet him.</p>  <p>I settled on a ride from Parker Colorado, north up the Cherry Creek trail, connecting west to the C-470 trail, out to the Mary Carter Greenway Trail north, connecting to the South Platte River trail (going north). From there the plan was to hear into Denver to the <a href="https://www.soallmayeat.org/" target="_blank">SAME Café</a>, run by friends of mine.</p>  <p>This route was going to be around 40 miles each way, longer in one direction than I've ever ridden, so I was half worried that making it back to Parker might be an issue, so I had an out, a shorter way back leaving SAME Café and heading to the Cherry Creek trail, which would have cut about 16 miles off the return route.</p>  <p>Friday after work, I was in Denver for the week providing custom <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> Training to a client, I stopped by the Littleton Bicycle Village store to pick up my rental bike that <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Im_a_cyclepath" target="_blank">@Im_a_cyclepath</a> hook</p>  <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/riding-from-parker-to-denver-in-colorado">Read More at www.bicycletips.com</a>
