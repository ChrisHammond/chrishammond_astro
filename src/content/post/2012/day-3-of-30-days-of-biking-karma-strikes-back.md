<p>Here we are, day 3 into <strong>30 days of biking</strong> (the month known as April). I came home from the office early today, left at 5pm, missing the Bay Area <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> User's Group meeting (<a href="https://www.baydug.org">www.baydug.org</a>). I stopped by the lbs (<a href="https://www.bikeworkshmb.com">www.bikeworkshmb.com</a>)&nbsp; to see what they might have in terms of a road bike for my wife, she's 5'10&rdquo; tall so that pretty much rules out most &ldquo;women's&rdquo; bikes, so I figured I would see what they had in a 56cm or so in men's. They had a couple of lower end Specialized Allez, similar to mine, but with lower end components.</p> <p>Unfortunately they don't appear to have much else right now, but I did figure out that they offer fitting services, so we will likely be scheduling that here in the next couple of weeks. I think she needs a 56cm, but I think we would be better off knowing for sure before buying.</p> <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you visit Bike Works go upstairs, they have stuff up there too! </p> <p>After getting home I decided to just rest and take it easy, watch some TV before the wife and baby got home. I thought about riding, but decided that my sick body wasn't yet up to a long ride. I've been fighting off a cold for two weeks, and this past weekend it struck me down, lots of coughing the past few days, I think I still have both lungs, but am not sure.</p> <p>After dinner I gave the baby a bath, side note: some how I have been tricked into this duty each night, for 1.6 years I managed to avoid it! (to be honest, I enjoy bath time playing around with Jacqueline, so I can't complain).</p> <p>Once the baby was down I decided I should at least get out and ride a little bit around the neighborhood to have some actual riding for Day 3 of 30 Days of Biking. </p> <p>This is when karma struck, in the form of rain.
