Basically they were to lose 30 lbs (goal weight of 255, I'm a big guy), inline skate 100 miles (I do like me some skating, I'm a freak I know this) and ride a bike 500 miles. At the beginning of 2011 the bike I had was a 2004 Diamondback XTS Moto, not exactly something you could see yourself riding 500 miles on (at least not me). So in June I picked up a Cannondale Quick CX 1 and began my journey. <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/19">Read More at www.bicycletips.com</a>
