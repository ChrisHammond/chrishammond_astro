excerpt: "Long ago when we started shipping jQuery resources with DotNetNuke we began offering a Host Setting which allowed you to use a HOSTED version of the jQuery resources. There are a number of benefits for using the hosted jQuery resources, of which I will mention some below, but there are also some potential disadvantages or risks to this as well. First a quick summary of what the setting allows you to do. With DNN (specifically with DNN 6.*+) we ship both jQuery resources and the jquery.ui resources. These are javascript files that exist on the web server that hosts your DotNetNuke website. Using the HOSTED setting allows you to basically have those files distributed from a CDN (content delivery network)."
