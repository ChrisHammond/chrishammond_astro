excerpt: "Well I faxed off the registration form for the first National tour of 2008. It looks like my fearless codriver fears long trips, bench seats, and using up too much vacation, so he won't be going to the Dixie National Tour. Dave Whitworth from SoloPerformance.com however will be codriving for the event."
