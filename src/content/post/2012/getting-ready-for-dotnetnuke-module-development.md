<p>Tomorrow morning I’ll be delivering one of our free <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> Explained web seminars, the 4th in our series of 6. This seminar is for Basic Module Development, in which I will show you how to quickly get up and running with custom module development for DotNetNuke.</p>  <p>If you haven’t signed up yet, you still can, go to the <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Intro/Web-Seminars/DotNetNuke-Explained-Basic-Module-Development.aspx" target="_blank">registration link</a>. After the web seminar is delivered and posted online that same registration link will allow you to watch the recording.</p>  <p>In order to get up and running with module development it is best to have your module development environment configured. Due to the seminar only being an hour I will be jumping in after my <strong>development environment is already setup</strong>, but this blog post will point you to the resources necessary to get your own environment setup and running.</p>  <p>Rather than regurgitate information that is already posted, this post will simply point you to the appropriate resources.</p>  <p>We’ve got a thorough page in the <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Wiki/Page/development-environment.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>DotNetNuke Wiki about Setting Up Your Development Environment</strong></a>. If you would like to try to follow along with the live web seminar, or the recording after the seminar, please first follow the steps outlined in that Wiki entry.</p>  <p>I will have completed all of the above steps on that Wiki page prior to the web seminar tomorrow morning.</p>  <h2>Useful Links from Web Seminar</h2>  <p>From there, I will do a few things in the webinar, I will refer to these links live, but finding them in the blog post will be helpful to many of you.</p>  <p>I will begin by downloading and installing the MSI for the <a href="https://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/" target="_blank">MSBuild Community Tasks project</a>.</p>  <p>Then I will be downloading and installing the custom C# project template from <a href="https://christoctemplate.codeplex.com">https://christoctemplate.codeplex.com</a>, you can also find a VB.net version of the template as well.</p>  <p>If you would like to customize the templates prior to use you can find instructions for installing and customizing the project templates on <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Wiki/Page/Customize-Project-Template.aspx" target="_blank">this wiki page</a>. I will not be customizing the template in the seminar.</p>  <p>After template installation I will walk you through the process of creating a project based on the template, the location as to where this project will live, and how it will work within DotNetNuke. We will make a few changes to the project to get it configured for our environment, then step through the process of packaging and installing the module within DotNetNuke.</p>  <p>From there we will actually add some functionality to the module utilizing Module Settings and code in our View and Edit controls.</p>  <p>For another approach to module development be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Video-Library.aspx#extension" target="_blank">Task Manager series of module development videos on the DotNetNuke Video Library</a>.</p><br /><a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/EntryId/3357/Getting-ready-for-DotNetNuke-Module-Development.aspx>More ...</a><div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/CatID/5.aspx>Extension Forge</a></div><div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/CatID/6.aspx>Reference</a></div><div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/CatID/16.aspx>Community</a></div><div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/CatID/15.aspx>DotNetNuke Corporation</a></div><div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/CatID/9.aspx>Development</a></div> <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/EntryId/3357/Getting-ready-for-DotNetNuke-Module-Development.aspx">Read More at www.dotnetnuke.com</a>
