Natalie and I are just over 48 hours away from our 100 mile bike ride in Davis California for the Team LIVESTRONG Challenge. We both haven't ridden near enough in the past two weeks, but hopefully we are still ready for the ride. We did put in a training ride up in Vacaville a few weeks ago (<a href="https://app.strava.com/rides/9515330" target="_blank">strava route</a>) and a climbing/raining ride in Maui during our vacation earlier this month (<a href="https://app.strava.com/rides/10171729" target="_blank">strava route</a>).</p>  <p>This afternoon at lunch I ran to REI and picked up some things for the weekend including:</p>  <ul>  <li>New gloves for me (old pair is pretty much falling apart)</li>  <li>Bottle cages for Natalie (had to get a pair that matched the ones on my bike)</li>  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00714F26U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00714F26U">Timbuk2 Goody Box Bike Accessory Case</a><img alt="" height="1" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chrishammondc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00714F26U" style="border-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-width: 0px;" width="1" /> , after the 100k ride we did back in May (never blogged about that one, <a href="https://app.strava.com/rides/7941281" target="_blank">strava route</a>) I have decided not to take a backpack, it was pretty much useless. This stem back from Timbuk2 will handle the few items I want to carry along.</li> </ul>  <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/dear-lance-i-want-to-be-a-fan-but-cant">Read More at www.bicycletips.com</a>
