It's only wednesday and I am worn out already :) </P> <P>I've also been helping a guy named Nick with a few projects his company is working on involving .Text and <a title="DotNetNuke.com" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">dotnetnuke</a>. He's made some interesting changes and it looks like the site is getting some good activity. I'll see if I can't post a link to it later if he doesn't mind.</P>
