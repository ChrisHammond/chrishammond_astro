<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to figure out a good way to get organized on my photos. Right now I have my directory structure broken down by d:\images\year\month\day</p>  <p>which doesn&#39;t work too bad, but I think I need an organization system that allows searching by content/topic, instead of just date.</p>  <p>Scoble posted about Flickr Organizr, I may have to try it out tonight.</p>  <p>Update 2024:</p>  <p>I actually still organize my photos with the same pattern as mentioned above, but nowadays Lightroom does all that organization for me. I have 20+ years of photos organized by Year/Month/Day and it works out pretty good.</p>  <p>I do need to go back and clean up my photos a bit. With 20+ years I have a lot of stuff I could simply purge, primarily starting with duplicate content. Content that I have the original image, along with smaller/resized versions of the same image. No need to keep the smaller copies, originals will suffice.&nbsp;</p>
