What's the next best thing to being able to go to <A href="https://www.teddrewes.com/Drewes.asp">Ted Drewes</A> for some custard? Being able to go to the Grocery store that is two minutes away to buy prepackaged Ted Drewes! I don't know why I didn't think about that before, but in the past week I think I've had Drewes 3 times, all from the Schnuck's right up the street!
