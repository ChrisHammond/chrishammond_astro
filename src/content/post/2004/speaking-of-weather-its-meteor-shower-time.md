<P>Looks like tonight may be a good night to go watch a meteor shower!</P> <P><A href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/12/13/sky.watch/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/12/13/sky.watch/index.html</A></P> <P>Saturday evening around midnight&nbsp;I was taking Pylon out and happened to yawn, as I yawned I looked straight up and saw a beautiful meteor streak across the night sky! I love trying to get out and watch meteor showers, kind of sucks not having anyone to go out and watch them with though.</P>
