<P>Well, it looks like it's time for me to dust off my Handy Man skills.</P> <P>Krista and I are dating again, and she just bought a house. Last night Bill and made a few trips to the hardware store and got her gas dryer hooked up and running. I guess the thing hasn't been run for 10-11 years, so it was a little dusty. When testing out the line Bill decided to start up the dryer while I was behind it, and of course the vent wasn't hooked up yet. I ended up getting COVERED in dust and dirt from who knows where.</P> <P>The dryer is hooked up and running now though, so she can start doing her laundry at home, which I know she is looking forward to.</P>
