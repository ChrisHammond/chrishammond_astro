<SPAN class=spnMessageText id=msg><FONT color=#333333 size=2>Well, I won my V37 last December. Around march I ordered the Upgrade. Upon upgrading it died. The upgrade process completed but when I went to do a cold boot after upgrading it just sat on the "Please wait for 30 seconds" and doesn't respond after that.<BR><BR>I emailed viewsonic, they've had me downgrade my rom (thanks for the link VS support!) I was then able to get back into the V37 w/ PC2002. I was told to try upgrading again. I've upgraded again, and I still have the same problem "Please wait for 30 seconds"<BR><BR>Anyone else run into this problem or have any suggestions? </FONT></SPAN>
