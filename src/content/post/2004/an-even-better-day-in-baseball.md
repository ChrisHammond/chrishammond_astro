<P><A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/archive/2004/10/06/313">a few days ago I lied</A>, it wasn't the best day in baseball. Up to this point YESTERDAY was the best day in Baseball!</P> <P>We spent yesterday afternoon at the Cardinals game 6 VS. The Astros. I took a couple hundred photos that I am currently uploading, I'll link to them in a bit when they are all uploaded.</P> <P>After the game I went to the Sports Page out in Columbia Illinois for Krista's volleyball game, and to watch the Red Sox win game 7 of the ALCS! Johnny Damon sure woke up yesterday, 6 RBIs for the hairy man, a 2 run shot, and a 4 run dinger!!!! Go Red Sox!</P> <P>Hopefully the Cardinals will win Game 7 of the NLCS tonight and then the Sox/Cards series will happen!</P>
