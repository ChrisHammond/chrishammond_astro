<P>I just got two tickets to see <A href="https://www.paparoach.com/">Papa Roach</A> and <A href="https://www.chronicfuture.com/">Chronic Future</A> at <A href="https://www.mississippinights.com/">Mississippi Nights</A> on Friday November 5th!</P> <P>The last time I saw <A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/gallery/albums/13">papa Roach was in April of 2000</A> right before Infest was released, Greg and I saw them at Pops in Sauget. I missed Chronic Future last time they were in town at the Creepy Crawl. </P> <P>This should be an awesome show! Now I need to find someone to go with me.</P>
