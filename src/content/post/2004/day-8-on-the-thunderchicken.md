<P>I spent about an hour wrenching on the chicken today. <A href="https://www.solo2.org/gallery/albums/20.aspx">I've posted Day 8 photos</A>, I had a few days where I didn't get any photos, mostly the days I was wiring up the inside of the dash, so my day 8 is actually just a guess.</P> <P>Today I started working on getting the power steering pump removed from the car. I didn't have too much luck though. Removed the PS resevoir, removed the alternator and moved the belt out of the way, but it looks like I have to remove the pulley from the pump, even though the manual I have says otherwise!</P> <P><A href="https://www.solo2.org/blogs/christoc/">More on the turbo bird over on my racing blog.</A></P>
