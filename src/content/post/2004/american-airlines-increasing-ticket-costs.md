<P>I got this email yesterday saying that American was going to raise their ticket fees. The gist I get out of it is that they want people to order online, where they don't have to pay a customer service rep to make the sale. If you need to buy form a person, you get to pay for that luxury... interesting, many banks do the same thing though.</P> <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> <P>Thank you for your business. To help us continue to offer high value and effectively compete in a fiercely competitive marketplace, American Airlines and American Eagle&#174; will implement a $5 service fee for those tickets purchased via our U.S. reservations centers and a $10 fee for tickets purchased at U.S. airport locations. There is no booking fee for self-booking and ticketing on AA.com&#174;. <BR><BR>Effective Monday, September 6, 2004, the non-refundable fee will apply per ticket, whether it is one-way or roundtrip, and also will apply to tickets redeemed as AAdvantage&#174; program awards. <BR><BR>These steps are necessary to ensure that we can compete effectively in a marketplace where charging fees for personalized, value-added services is becoming a common practice. Low-cost carriers often charge a fee on tickets issued with the help of their reservations center or airport staff. <BR><BR>We appreciate your business and your continuing loyalty to American Airlines. <BR><BR></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
