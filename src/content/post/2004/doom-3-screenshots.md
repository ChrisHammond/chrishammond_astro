<p>Check out my gallery of Doom 3 screenshots (link no longer available)!</p>  <p>I got a new video card today, new to me at least, a Nvidia FX 5900 Ultra 256mb. Courtesy of my little Nvidia fairy :) Thanks Dude!</p>  <p>It rocks! I also got a copy of Doom 3 today from Best Buy, if you are looking for it, tell them Circuit City has it in their flyer for $45, Best Buy will match the price.</p>  <p>So far the graphics are absolutely amazing. Gameplay to me seems to be typical Doom, which is good or bad, depending on your preference.</p>  <p>It&#39;s late, I&#39;ll try to do a review later this week.</p>
