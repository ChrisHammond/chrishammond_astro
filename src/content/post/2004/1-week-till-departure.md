In less than a week I will be back in sunny California! I fly out of STL on the evening of the 22nd, headed to Long Beach until January 2nd. It'll be nice to get out of MO for a while, be able to have some fresh smoggy air, and breathe again!
 
If I am out there and my sinus problems completely go away I will have to think long and hard about leaving the midwest and going back west for good!
 
Lots of stuff left to do before next Wednesday. Tonight I'm off to the Ho Ho Show (<A href="https://www.1057thepoint.com">www.1057thepoint.com</A>). Tomorrow <A href="https://www.wmbtech.com/">Bill</A> is having a Poker party at his place. Saturday is Nelson's wedding party.
 
I really need to do some shopping before I go! Shopping in California on the 23rd and 24th is a huge mess!
