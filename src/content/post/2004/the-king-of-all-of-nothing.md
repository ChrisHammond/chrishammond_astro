excerpt: "So the alarm comes on this morning and I hit snooze the required 3-4 times per morning. It's blaring 105.7 at 7AM, which has the king of all that is bad, Howard Stern, on in the mornings.

This morning I actually listened to the show for a bit though. He had Jonathan Davis from Korn on this morning, talking about Jonathan's childhood and family life. It was kind of interesting, as I've always been a HUGE Korn fan, ever since Kevin Corcoran (sp?) gave me a tape of their first album back in 94. I knew he had a screwed up childhood, but to hear him talk about it was definitely interesting. ..."
