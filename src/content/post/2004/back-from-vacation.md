excerpt: "I'm back from&nbsp;9 days out of town. First I went to the SCCA Solo II Nationals in Topeka Kansas you can check out some of the photos from the ProSolo Finale https://www.solo2.org/gallery/albums/9.aspx&nbsp;and from Nationals https://www.solo2.org/gallery/albums/8.aspx Thursday morning, after 4 hours of sleep, I drove back to St. Louis and caught a flight Thursday evening to Phoenix for Faye's wedding. Check out some of the photos from the wedding! https://www.chrishammond.com/gallery/albums/49.aspx Overall it was a good 9 days. Nationals didn't go as well as I had hoped, but it was better than last year. I did however get dehydrated one day and fairly sick, but after a few gatorades I was back to normal. Hopefully more details on the past 9 days later, I have work to catch up..."
