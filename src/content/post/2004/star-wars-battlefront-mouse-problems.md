<P>Well, I got Star Wars Battlefront at the recommendation of Bill today. Install went fine and dandy but as soon as I start the game up my mouse crawls to the top right corner. It's hard to click on items as you have to move to their lower right and click when the mouse rolls over that item...</P> <P>Now I need to find a fix for this.</P> <P>UPDATE:</P> <P>trying this fix <A href="https://forums.lucasarts.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5737&amp;tstart=0">https://forums.lucasarts.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5737&amp;tstart=0</A><BR></P> <DIV style="OVERFLOW: auto; COLOR: #dddddd; WORD-WRAP: break-word"><FONT color=#000000>If your mouse cursor is drifting or losing input on the game's menu screens, please download and install the latest software for your mouse available from the manufacturer's website.<BR><BR>If you have a joystick or gamepad connected to the system, and you plan to play the game using the keyboard and mouse, you should try disconnecting the joystick or gamepad from the system temporarily to see if this corrects the issue. You may need to calibrate your controller in the Windows' Gaming Options Control Panel to correct this. </FONT></DIV>
