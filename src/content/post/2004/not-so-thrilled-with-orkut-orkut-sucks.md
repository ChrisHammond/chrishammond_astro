<P>I signed up for Orkut back when it was first announced, thinking wow this could be cool. I hadn't really touched it since. Today I started playing around with it again. And all I can say so far is that Orkut Sucks. <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/archive/2004/05/10/129364.aspx">I keep getting the darn No Donut For You error.</A>&nbsp;I pretty much have to do anything I want to do twice, first time&nbsp;I get an error, the second time it may actually go through.</P> <P>Orkut blows!</P>
