excerpt: "Interesting mix of Jay Z and the Beatles. A friend of mine pointed this out today. It's available for download at  https://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html &#8220;DJ Danger Mouse remixed the vocals from Jay-Z's The Black Album and the Beatles' White Album and called his creation The Grey Album. He sent about 3,000 promo copies out, and was soon served with a cease-and-desist notice from EMI, who owns the rights to the White Album master. Danger Mouse complied with EMI's order, but Stay Free! (sponsors of the Illegal Art Exhibit) and other fans and activists continued distributing the record over the Internet. EMI sent legal threats to many of us as well but has since backed down, at least for the time being.  Just when we think our legal troubles are behind us, SONY/ATV -- who owns the rights to the Beatles' compositions -- sends our internet service provider (ISP) a DMCA takedown notice (3/1/2004). Fortunately, we have secured legal representation from the EFF and Kurt Opsahl, and have moved our website to the Online Policy Group, a nonprofit ISP devoted to free speech. Here is our response to Sony/ATV. Stay tuned!..."
