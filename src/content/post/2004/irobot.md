<a title="russ" href="https://www.russ3.com/" target="_blank">Russ</a> and I went and saw &#8220;I, Robot&#8221; tonight. It was a decent movie, entertaining :) Nothing spectacular, but worth the $8.
 
The kid at the window asked &#8220;student or adult&#8221; I said, adult, I don't have my student ID. Come to look in my wallet, and what's there? My ID. oops $2 down the drain :)
