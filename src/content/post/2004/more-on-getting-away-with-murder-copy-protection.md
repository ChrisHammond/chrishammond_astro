<P>Well, <A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/archive/2004/08/31/256">i figured out a bit more</A>. Track 1 on the CD Getting Away With Murder from Papa Roach will not play on my machine here at work. Trying to play track one on either iTunes or WM Player 10 is not possible and brings both applications to a crawl.</P> <P>The rest of the tracks play fine. I'll try the CD at home tonight, I didn't get a chance to test&nbsp;it last night.</P>
