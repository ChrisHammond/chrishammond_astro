<p>I got the urge to redesign, as I do every few weeks. I've added a new photo gallery, with a little bit better functionality than the last one. I'll try to continually add items to it. So far I'm not so sure I like my organizational structure in the gallery, but it will do until I come up with something better.</p> <p>What do you think of the new site?</p> <p>-Chris Hammond</p>
