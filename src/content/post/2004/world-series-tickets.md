<P>Get your World Series tickets! Oh wait, I ALREADY HAVE THEM! :)</P> <P>Auntie Carol and I are heading to Game 4 on Wednesday night! She's flying in Wednesday afternoon and out Thursday morning. I've also got a standing room only ticket to Game 5 if it is necessary on Thursday night.</P> <P>I predicted this would be an expensive week, and it has proven to be so!</P> <P><A href="https://felone.blogspot.com/2004/10/chris-is-redsox-fan.html">As for me complaining or gloating for the next year</A>. It's not likely, I'll&nbsp;be on a Red Sox Fan high for a while, but I'm not one to make continual jabs, I only made one comment about the Yankees to <A href="https://felone.blogspot.com/">Brian</A>... And that was after the Sox came back from 0-3 to win the Series! I am still a Cardinals fan, I still have two hats, a Jersey, and who knows what other Paraphanalia, it is all just retired until after the World Series, this is the Red Sox year!</P> <P>Let's do this one right Red Sox, we'd love to see it done in Four, but if it's done in 5 I'll be there too!</P>
