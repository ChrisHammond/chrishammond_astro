It appears that my claims that <A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/archive/2004/09/01/258">papa Roach's Getting Away with Murder is copy protected</A>were false, thank goodness.
 
I finally got to test the CD out on my home PC and am able to play all the tracks without a problem. So something with the data on the CD must be causing problems with track one on my machine at work. Just another reason to hate the machine I run on at work!
