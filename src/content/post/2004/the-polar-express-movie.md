excerpt: "I'm still not decided on what I really think about this movie. I saw it last night, it's a good story. I for some reason don't remember the book at all, though I remember the cover. The animations done for the movie really are kind of freaky. From what I read earlier in the week the animations were created off of the movements of actual actors, just digitized and inserted into the movie. The weird thing was the eyes and mouths, they just didn't look real enough. I think the movie probably could have been done better either in cartoon format, or with real life actors. It's still a good Christmas movie to see, so in the coming weeks take your kids to see..."
