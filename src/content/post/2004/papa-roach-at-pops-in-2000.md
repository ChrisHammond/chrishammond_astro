<p>I found some old pictures I took back in April of 2000 at Pop's in Sauget Illinois.</p> <p>Papa Roach was doing a tour right before Infest came out, Greg and I went, had a blast. I talked to Dave and Jerry a little bit before they played, it was nice to be able to do that, I'm sure nowadays that would be next to impossible. It's good to see they've blown up though.</p> <p>Here are the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/322835995">Papa Roach Photos</a>.</p>
