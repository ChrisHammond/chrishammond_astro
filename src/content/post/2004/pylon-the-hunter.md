<P>I let pylon out a few minutes ago, next thing I know I hear something weird squeeking outside. Looks like we got Rabbit number 2 tonight. He got one back in February I think, but it was still alive and kicking, and as far as I can tell once I put it outside the fence it left, or something else came and got it. The rabbit tonight didn't fare near as lucky.</P> <P>I went out there and it sounded like pylon had a toy in his mouth, I heard a clicking, well, that was bones....</P> <P>Finally got him to drop the rabbit, which at first seemed to still be alive, though not moving. I sat him over the fence, went in and grabbed a flash light and some paper towels. As far as I could tell upon return he was dead :( poor little guy. I was afraid I was going to have to kill him myself, which I didn't want to do.</P>
