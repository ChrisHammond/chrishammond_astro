<p>Here begins what could be a very interesting week for Red Sox fans everywhere!</p>  <p>I&#39;ll be posting my thoughts on the week, and my experiences here in St. Louis. I have yet to procure any tickets to the World Series, but I&#39;ll be going down the the stadium each night trying to get tickets on the street.</p>  <p>Today (Saturday Game1) I was walking in West County mall, into one store and right back out. I got boo&#39;d when I was walking in, and on the way out an older lady told me she hopes the Red Sox lose!</p>  <p>I then went to Shop-n-Save on Lindbergh in Soco, where I was almost run over by an older lady in a sedan, who knowingly saw me... Inside the store one of the employees said &ldquo;Does Damon play for the Astros? Oh, that&#39;s a Red Sox Jersey, I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s wearing that&rdquo; I don&#39;t know if she thought I couldn&#39;t hear, or didn&#39;t care. When checking out another employee came up to me and wished me luck, said she was a Cards fan but her daughter lives in Maine and is a Red Sox fan. On the way out a lady was finishing her cigarette, in front of her 12 year old (guess at the age) daughter, &ldquo;Red Sox????&rdquo; I just said, Yes....</p>  <p>This will be a fun week! :)</p>
