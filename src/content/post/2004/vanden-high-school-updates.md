I've gotten a few things updated on&nbsp;Vanden High School&nbsp;over the past week or so. I think I'm going to try to provide current school year info on the site, to make it more useful as an information source. I'll also be adding blogs to the site before the end of the week. Giving the students and past students of <A title=VHS href="https://www.vandenhighschool.com/" target=_blank>Vanden High School</A> a place to blog on the web!
