If you haven't seen Shaun of the Dead yet go see it! It is an excellent movie. Funny as heck, and even a little jump out and scare you here and there. The movie is about two british guys who fight off&nbsp;a town full of Zombies, while the world faces&nbsp;an epidemic onslaught of Zombies. This is definitely a see it in theaters type of movie, or on DVD with 5.1 sound.
