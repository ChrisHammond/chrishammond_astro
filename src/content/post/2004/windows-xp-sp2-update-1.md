<P><A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/archive/2004/08/26/241">update for the original post</A></P> <P>So far so good, I've tried remotely RDP'ng to the machine&nbsp;I am on, and received the connection window. I'm off to work now, will verify that I can actually connect and login to RDP from there. Then I'll do some more looking around into XP SP2.</P> <P>So far I've received two notifications for unblocking access for the firewall. one for AIM and one for activesync....</P> <P>UPDATE:<BR>My links on my links toolbar in IE are all out of order!</P>
