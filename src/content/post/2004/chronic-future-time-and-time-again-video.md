This morning while getting ready I had directTV on channel 817, which is the alternative music station.
 
A catchly little tune came on by <a href="https://www.chronicfuture.com/">Chronic Future</a>, called Time and Time Again. After a quick google search I found <a href="https://www.chronicfuture.com/">Chronic Future's web site</a>.
 
Here's a link to the video for <a href="https://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/interscope/chronicfuture/linesinmyface/video/timeandtimeagain/000_timeandtimeagain.asx">Time and Time Again</a>
