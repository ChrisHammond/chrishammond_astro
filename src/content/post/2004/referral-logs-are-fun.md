<p>I was looking through my site statistics for <a title="the ultimate autocross web site" href="https://www.solo2.org/" target="_blank">solo2.org</a> today and came across an incoming link to the site that has brought 30 people to the site in the past couple of days. So I go to check it out.</p> <p><a href="https://350zuk.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=4904">https://350zuk.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=4904</a></p> <p>Harsh! Oh well, I liked the stripe while I had it on the car.</p>
