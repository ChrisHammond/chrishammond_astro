<P>I made it to California alright, but you would think that if your flight info says STL to Long beach, you'd go straight to long beach. Well, no, I had to stop in Phoenix. Shortly before we stopped though they announce that the plane is going on to Boise, and the flight crew is going to Long Beach.</P> <P>So I had to change planes, the pilots changed planes, the flight number stayed the same...</P> <P>Crazy company.</P> <P>Made it here, went to In-n-out and got myself a double double, fries and a shake!</P>
