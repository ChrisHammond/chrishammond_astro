So a few weeks ago some of my fraternity brothers were talking about <A href="https://www.redvsblue.com">RedVSBlue</A>. I hadn't heard of it before, but somehow stumbled across it again today. I think I've watched/listened to 18 of the episodes. Check out this <A href="https://files.redvsblue.com/3xTG/RvB_TG_LoRes.wmv">Thanksgiving PSA</A>&nbsp;it has a funny take on the Red VS Blue states event back in early November.
