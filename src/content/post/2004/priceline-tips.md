<P>If you are looking for a hotel on Priceline here are a few tips.</P> <P>Bid early, if you know you are going somewhere months in advance, and know it won't be cancelled, bid as early as you can. After 72 hours of your first bid you can try again if necessary.</P> <P>If you are bidding in an area that has 1-2-3 or more stars, always bid for the highest star. you can rebid afterwards by choosing a lower start. If you start at a 1 star though they will not let you bid again without changing your dates of travel.</P> <P>If bidding on a car, bid economy. I bid $25 on an econ for 3 days in Phoenix, they offered me a $6 upgrade to a midsized car per day, I took that. With all the fees and taxes things work out to about $42/day for the car, but it's also unlimited mileage, through Budget.</P>
