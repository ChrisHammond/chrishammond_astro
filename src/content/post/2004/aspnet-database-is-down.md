Something happened today and it appears to the database server that runs the <A href="https://www.asp.net">www.asp.net</A> site, along with <A href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">www.dotnetnuke.com</A> weblogs.asp.net forums.asp.net and quite a few other web sites has gone down. Hopefully it'll be back up soon! I think I'm going to try to bring all my blog posts over from weblogs.asp.net over into this blog when it gets back up, so I have control over all the archiving.....
