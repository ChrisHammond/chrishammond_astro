<P>Based on <A href="https://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/archive/2004/06/30/169950.aspx">various reviews</A> and other blogs I've read I went and purchased my first PS2 game in almost two years. The only thing my PS2 has been used for as of late is to play DVDs in my bedroom.</P> <P>Last night Russ and I headed out to BB to pick it up. After playing for a few hours all I can say is &#8220;damn cool&#8221;. I'm hoping to get some more time playing it this weekend and get some more time to sit and play it, after that i'll try to writeup a better review.</P> <P>One thing so far about Spider-Man 2 The Game it's only single player.....</P>
