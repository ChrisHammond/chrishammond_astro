<P>I emailed the guys who run <A href="https://www.stlnet.org">StlNet.org</A> and asked about starting up a STL <a title="DotNetNuke.com" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">dotnetnuke</a> users group.</P> <P>Hopefully they provide some useful information which I can get started with. I'll probably get started on a web site for the group shortly, gauge some interest and try to get a first meeting setup.</P> <P>Anyone interested? Post a comment here until I get the site running.</P>
