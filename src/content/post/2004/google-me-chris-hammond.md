<p>What happens when you google for Chris Hammond? Well, you get mostly baseball news, one of my weblogs, and then some travel and photography pages for other Chris Hammond&#39;s out there.</p>  <p>I&#39;ve been attempting to get my results up higher in the rankings for 9 months now, with quite a bit of success, but still unable to beat out ESPN for the #1 spot.</p>  <p>So today I was driving home and though of a new idea. &ldquo;Google Me&rdquo;</p>  <p>More on the idea later, but it looks like I have another idea for a project that won&#39;t generate any money :)</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Update in July 2024: I really wish I knew what the &quot;Google Me&quot; idea was, I guess I never took that anywhere. I&#39;ve been once again working on improving this website and search results pointing to it. I think I have figured out why I&#39;ve lost a lot of my traffic and am working on getting some of those issues resolved. Long story short, I think much of my &quot;aggregation&quot; functionality that I added over the years where I pulled in all the blog posts from my various websites has been the downfall here.&nbsp;</p>
