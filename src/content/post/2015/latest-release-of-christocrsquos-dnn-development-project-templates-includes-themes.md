<p>For years I have maintained a set of <a href="https://store.dnnsoftware.com/home/product-details/dnn-visual-studio-project-templates?r=6dbcef43e10e47ad9eb6" target="_blank">Visual Studio project templates</a> that are used by thousands of people to quickly and easily create Modules for the DotNetNuke Content Management System, and for years, I have had people request that I create a project template for creating a DNN Skin (now known as Themes).</p> <p>This weekend I finally took the time to do just that. <a href="https://store.dnnsoftware.com/home/product-details/dnn-visual-studio-project-templates?r=6dbcef43e10e47ad9eb6" target="_blank">With the latest release of my Visual Studio project templates</a>, you can now create a Theme for DNN. When doing so, you will be presented with a basic skin, using Bootstrap v3.1.1, based on my <a href="https://cjh.am/1mGBQby" target="_blank">HammerFlex</a> theme for DotNetNuke. </p> <p>Why would I create a theme project template, that is based on an actual skin? I honestly believe that is the best way for people to learn how to do Themes (skins) in DNN, you can start from scratch, and that is the way that I used to start my skins, I would create a skin using one of my <a href="https://www.christoc.com/Projects/Module-Development-Templates" target="_blank">Module Development templates</a>, and then rip out the meat and potatoes from the module project to make the Skin. You can still take this approach, but I feel that starting with a Bootstrap based skin will likely help people get up and running more quickly, and be able to leverage the capabilities of Bootstrap for creating responsive themes for the DNN Content Management System.</p> <p><a href="https://www.christoc.com/Tutorials/All-Tutorials/aid/8" target="_blank">To get started with the newest Project Template, be sure to read the tutorial I put together.</a></p>
