excerpt: "Over the past few years I’ve been threatening to get into remote control multi-rotor aircraft. Thanks to Andrew McMaster (www.clearuphere.com) I finally pulled the trigger and have built my first aircraft. I say first, because I am pretty sure it will be the first of many.  My first build was a DJI F450, using a kit ordered from UAVProducts.com, as well as many other parts from various sources. If you are looking to get into quadcopters/multi-rotors (don’t call them drones) you need to ask yourself a few questions."

<p><em>I wrote this post long ago, but never posted it because I didn’t get the video done. The build occurred in April/May 2014, and I finally put together music (recorded myself, except for the drum track) in January 2015.</em></p> <p>Over the past few years I’ve been threatening to get into remote control multi-rotor aircraft. Thanks to Andrew McMaster (<a href="https://www.clearuphere.com">www.clearuphere.com</a>) I finally pulled the trigger and have built my first aircraft. I say first, because I am pretty sure it will be the first of many.</p>  [YouTube:7y2xQFyV6_c]  <p> My first build was a DJI F450, using a kit ordered from UAVProducts.com, as well as many other parts from various sources. If you are looking to get into quadcopters/multi-rotors (don’t call them drones) you need to ask yourself a few questions.</p> <h2>Questions to ask before you buy a quadcopter</h2> <ol> <li>Do you want to buy something and start flying?</li> <li>Do you want to build something, and then start flying, maybe?</li></ol> <p>I went with option 2, because I believe there is a ton of fun to be had in building. The problem with building is that documentation is weak, so you have to figure some things out on your own, and you have to do a lot of watching YouTube videos and reading Forums to figure out some of the things.</p> <p>After you decide if you want to go with the build, or ready to fly route, you should then ask a few additional questions.</p> <h2>More questions to ask before you buy a quadcopter</h2> <ol> <li>What do you want the quadcopter for?</li> <li>Do you want to do aerial photography?</li> <li>Do you want to do aerial videography?</li> <li>Do you want to race?</li> <li>Do you want to just fly?</li></ol> <p>If you answer yes to 2 or 3, then you need to seriously consider what you are trying to do. If you are happy with taking pictures/videos with a GoPro, than most off the shelf multi-rotor aircraft will meet your needs, such as the DJI Phantom, or the QX 350. If you don’t want to shoot with a GoPro, but want to use a larger camera, you really need to start with a GoPro and a quad that works for that. After you give that a go, you can build a rig that will carry a larger camera, but know going into that, you will spend thousands of dollars and likely lose thousands of dollars (and cameras) when you crash.</p> <p>If you want to race, you might consider getting a 250mm quad, these are units that are smaller than the Phantom or QX350 (and much smaller than the F450 I built), while you can strap a GoPro on one, you typically would mount an FPV camera of some sort, without any stabilization hardware for the camera.</p> <p>Here is a list of some of the parts I ordered and used for my DJI F450 Flamewheel build.</p> <h2>List of Parts (source link):</h2> <ul> <li>DJI F450 ARF w/ Naza V2 w/ GPS (<a title="https://www.uavproducts.com/product.php?id_product=288" href="https://www.uavproducts.com/product.php?id_product=288">https://www.uavproducts.com/product.php?id_product=288</a>) this is the main unit itself, the body, the electronic speed controllers, the motors, the propellers, the “computer”, the LED module, and the GPS/Compass.  <li>DJI Landing Gear (<a title="https://www.uavproducts.com/product.php?id_product=203" href="https://www.uavproducts.com/product.php?id_product=203">https://www.uavproducts.com/product.php?id_product=203</a>) I had this on for the first couple of flights, but replaced with a different base after adding a Gimbal/Camera  <li>Futaba 14SG-h w/ R7008SB (<a title="https://futabarc.com/systems/futk9410-14sg/index.html" href="https://futabarc.com/systems/futk9410-14sg/index.html">https://futabarc.com/systems/futk9410-14sg/index.html</a>) The transmitter, and receiver both, I purchased from an Ebay vendor as Tower Hobbies didn’t have them in stock, an hour later they did  <li>XT60 Connectors (<a title="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J80EWS4/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J80EWS4/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J80EWS4/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>) to wire up the batteries and Gimbal  <li>Venom 30C 4S 3200mAh batteries (<a title="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FE0R4WI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FE0R4WI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FE0R4WI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>)  <li>Venom 25C 4S 3600mAh battery (<a title="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027GD9LM/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027GD9LM/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027GD9LM/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>)  <li>Tarot 2d Gimbal (<a title="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F2726VC/ref=oh_details_o06_s01_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F2726VC/ref=oh_details_o06_s01_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F2726VC/ref=oh_details_o06_s01_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>) used to mount/control the GoPro  <li>Fpv Anti-vibration Multifunction Landing Skid Kit F450 F550 (<a title="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FLLL85O/ref=oh_details_o06_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FLLL85O/ref=oh_details_o06_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FLLL85O/ref=oh_details_o06_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>) used to mount the Gimbal to the quad. Requires creative use of zip ties to mount the F450 to it. Same with the Gimbal, the rails don’t “fit” the gimbal rail mount.  <li>Battery Voltage checker and alarm (<a title="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081Y6QC8/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081Y6QC8/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081Y6QC8/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>) good for testing which batteries are charge, could also be mounted on quad to warn you of pending doom  <li>Buck Converter (<a title="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009HPB1OI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009HPB1OI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009HPB1OI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>) used to step the 14.8v battery down to 12v for the Gimbal </li></ul> <p>I’m sure I missed some parts, but hopefully that provides you a basic list of what I used to get things up and running.</p>
