excerpt: "Over the holiday here in St. Louis we had an abnormally large amount of rain, with that has come complete chaos in the rivers, primarily the Meramec river, but also high levels on the Missouri and flooding from the Mississippi river. I had a little time this afternoon after an all day meeting at the office to head home quickly and grab some of my gear, I headed up to Bluff View Trail, a new trail here in Wildwood, MO that has a great view over the Meramec River. Two weeks ago I went out on the trail with a buddy and rode my MTB for the first time, on Christmas Eve I took Natalie and Daniel and we went and hiked it a bit. Little did I know taking a photo there that day would provide me a cool opportunity to shot a before and during shot of the extensiveness of the flooding going on.  The photo on the left below is from 12/24/2015 and the photo on the right is from tonight, 12/30/2015   "
