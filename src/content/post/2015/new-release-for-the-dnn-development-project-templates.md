<p>A few months ago I released V4 of my <a href="https://cjh.am/dnntemplates" target="_blank">DNN Development templates</a>, which included a new project template for Themes (skins). This weekend I was working on a new theme (skin) for a customer project and came across a few changes I needed/wanted to make to the Theme project template, so you get to benefit from those changes as I have put a new release out of the project templates.</p> <p>The changes are limited to the Theme project template, no changes to the Module project templates this time around. Here’s a quick overview of the changes</p> <ul> <li>Fixed priority loading for the Bootstrap JS file to correct an issue with DNN dropdown fields (such as problems not being able to update a user’s photo in their profile)</li> <li>Fixed DNNRadio background, Bootstrap was throwing a BG color on it.</li> <li>Upgraded to Bootstrap V3.3.4 (from v3.3.1)</li></ul> <h2>Installing the Templates</h2> <p>If you have previously installed the templates from the Visual Studio Gallery you can download updates there, using the Tools&gt;Extensions and Updates menu item in Visual Studio 2013.</p> <p>If you downloaded the VSIX Manually previously, you can grab that again from <a href="https://cjh.am/dnntemplates" target="_blank">the DNN Store</a>.</p> <p>If you need help getting the templates installed be sure to <a href="https://www.christoc.com/Products/DNN-Development-Templates" target="_blank">check out our tutorial video</a> </p> <p>After you have the templates installed be sure to check out some of our other templates.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.christoc.com/tutorials/aid/1">Setting up your DotNetNuke Module Development Environment</a> <li><a href="https://www.christoc.com/tutorials/aid/2">Installing Christoc's DotNetNuke Module Development Templates</a> <li><a href="https://www.christoc.com/tutorials/aid/3">Customizing the latest DotNetNuke Module Development Project Templates</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.christoc.com/Tutorials/All-Tutorials/aid/8" target="_blank">Creating a theme with the latest DNN development project templates</a></li></ul>
