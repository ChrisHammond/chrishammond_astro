excerpt: "For the last 6 months or more our Dyson V6 Handheld Vacuum has only worked for 5 to 10 seconds at a time. If you kept the trigger pressed down, it would &quot;stop&quot; after 5 or 10 seconds and wouldn&#39;t run again until you plugged into the wall charger for a few minutes.  I finally broke down and ordered a new battery from Amazon for our Dyson V6 hand held vacuum, the new unit arrived today. I put the new battery in, and even without charging it I was able to run the vaccum for 30+ seconds at the MAX setting, without the unit stopping.&nbsp; "
