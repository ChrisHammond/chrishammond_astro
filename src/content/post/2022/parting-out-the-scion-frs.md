excerpt: "The time has finally come, time that I finally have, to try to start getting the 2016 Scion FR-S parted out.  Yesterday I got the car unburried from the smaller side of the garage and pulled it into the bigger 2 car bay.  First things first, I got the car up on jackstands, after finding the wheel lock, and took the Konig wheels off the car. David Z picked those up from me yesterday afternoon, so the wheel and tires from the car are gone.  &nbsp; "
