excerpt: "For the second year in a row I was out at Indian Camp Creek park for the ICC Challenge Mountain Bike Race. I tried to get a shot of everyone, I likely missed at least a few folks (big hitters and the e-bike class), but I've posted almost four thousand photos.  Find Your Photos  Use the &ldquo;search&rdquo; on my SmugMug site to more easily find your photos by Bib number, I manually tagged every picture with a bib number if I could read your number plate, if not, sorry you didn't get tagged.  View, Search and Purchase Photos  Here is a slideshow of the photos, but you'll have an easier time viewing the photos with the link above!    I had a blast out there and appreciate all the feedback I've had on photos posted.  You can purchase a high quality (43 megapixel) digital download of my shots via the links above.  Thanks, see you on the trails!  Chris - RainbowMarks Photography "
