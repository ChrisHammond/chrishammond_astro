<p>Hello there, long time no see&hellip;. Where has SpecFRS gone? Well here's the story of how my autocross car came to a very sad demise, and a couple of tips for you on how to not have it happen to yourself.</p>  <p>First and foremost: Look into Autocross insurance. Lockton Motorsports provides insurance options that cover cars DURING autocross events, you should definitely <a href="https://locktonmotorsports.com/autocross-off-track/">check them out</a>. It is very likely that your normal street car insurance policy will NOT cover you, and you asking them if they do may even cause red flags to be raised. I did NOT have autocross insurance on my 2016 Scion FR-S, even though I had looked into it a couple of weeks before the incident, I didn't pull the trigger (if memory serves, it was like $225 for the year for my car), and would have likely made 2021 not be near as bad as it ended up.</p>  <p><img src="https://www.specfrs.com/assets/images_out/6-13-2021/side-800-158409714.jpg" srcset="https://www.specfrs.com/assets/images_out/6-13-2021/side-400-158409714.jpg 400w, https://www.specfrs.com/assets/images_out/6-13-2021/side-600-158409714.jpg 600w, https://www.specfrs.com/assets/images_out/6-13-2021/side-800-158409714.jpg 800w, https://www.specfrs.com/assets/images_out/6-13-2021/side-1000-158409714.jpg 1000w" /></p>  <a href="https://www.specfrs.com/autocross-accident-why-you-need-autocross-insurance">Read More at www.specfrs.com</a>
