excerpt: "For the past month or two I've slowly been trying to purge things around the house. I'm not moving fast enough, with cleaning out my parents apartment more stuff has definitely come into the house than has gone out. 2023 will be the year of cleaning up, so I will try to keep this blog post updated with active, and inactive Ebay listings that I have going.  Update: With as many different listings as I have going, maybe I&#39;ll just link to my Ebay profile instead of trying to maintain the list here too! "
