<p>A few weeks before the 2023 MR340 I posted in the Facebook group asking if people wanted the MR340 logo overlaid on the photos from the event. The response was mixed, probably around 50/50, with some people wanting it, and others preferring not to have it.</p>  <p>I err'd on the side of not including the logo on the photos that were made available for purchase from the event, but had every intention of figuring out a way to allow the people who wanted the logo, to add the logo, post purchase.</p>  <p>Well, I am proud to announce I've come up with a way for you to do that!</p>  <p>Introducing <a href="https://PHOTOMARK.CO">PHOTOMARK.CO</a>, a simple way for you to add the MR340 logo to your photos from the event.

Though you will need to do this one at a time for each photo you want to add the logo to.</p>  <p>If you haven't purchased any MR340 photos yet, you can <a href="https://rainbowmarks.smugmug.com/2023/Watersports/MR340">do so here</a>.</p>  <p>Currently the website is pretty simple, allowing you to choose only from the 2023 MR340 logo options, in the future I might make it a little more customizable to support future, and past, events!</p>  <p>This is 100% brand new, custom code, so if you run into any problems, <a href="https://chrishammond.com/contact">please don't hesitate to reach out</a> with feedback!</p>  <a href="https://rainbowmarks.com/Events/2023/08/PHOTOMARK/">Read More at rainbowmarks.com</a>
