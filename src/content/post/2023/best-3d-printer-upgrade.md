<p>So a few years ago I picked up a 3d Printer, to be specific, a Monoprice Maker Select Plus (I3 Prusa clone). It has been hit or miss, I’ve made some enhancement to it, many that helped, and a few that didn’t (never could get BLTouch working).</p><p>Even with enhancements, I struggled to get prints working properly, I would have bed adherence issues and prints would fail. That all changed once I got the <a href="https://amzn.to/40cfjZo" target="_blank">Fulament Fula-Flex 2.0 for the Monoprice</a>. </p><p>This magnetic print bed has been a godsend. I can easily remove prints, I can easily clean the platform, and prints stick to the platform without trouble.</p><p>If you’re having problems, maybe using the original platform, or even have tried a glass bed, <a href="https://amzn.to/40cfjZo" target="_blank">give the Fula-Flex 2.0 a try</a>, it has made my prints way more successful and taken the frustration out of failed prints.</p>
