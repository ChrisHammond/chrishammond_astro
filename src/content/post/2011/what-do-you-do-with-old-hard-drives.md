I’m not talking 1, or 2, but every hard drive you’ve ever owned and no longer use, from 1.7gb up to 750gb (minus a couple of 750s I destroyed while in Colorado)? Here’s my dilemma, I’ve got this stack of hard drives (pictured on the left), half of them I’ve gone through and made sure I have removed all the content I wanted to save on them, deleted the rest.</p>  <p>Now, I know not to just toss these into the trash, it would be theoretically possible to recover the data, even if I delete them. And now that I am becoming a Maker (or dreaming of becoming one) I feel like tossing all that hardware would be a waste of metal.</p>  <p>So how do I dispose of old hard drives? Well I plan to take them apart.</p>  <p>I’m sure you’re wondering, how much data is actually on that stack of hard drives? A pathetic 1.5tb, 1/2 of that coming from a single 750gb drive.</p>  <p>Stay tuned for a photo later this week of all the remnants.</p>
