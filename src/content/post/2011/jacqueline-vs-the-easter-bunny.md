<p>We spent today doing family things, and I must say, it was a great day!</p> <p>First we all headed down to Half Moon Bay to check out two rental houses down there. We need to find a larger place, I need an office, and Natalie needs a bedroom, so we are looking for a 3br place instead of our current 2br place.</p> <p>We looked at two places, one that was a 4br with 1100 sq/ft, and one that was 3br and 1700 sq/ft. The 1100 sq/ft house had nicer amenities, new appliances, bathrooms, etc, but the master bedroom was barely big enough to fit our california king bed, there's no way it would also fit the rest of our bedroom furniture.</p> <p>The second place was perfect! While the appliances aren't updated, size wise it should work out great. We told the agent that showed it to us that we were very interested and got an application to fill out. I sent that in this evening, I had intended to do it earlier, but as I was filling it out, I realized that I didn't have my driver's license. I left it at Safeway yesterday, so I had to run out and get that.</p> <p>We're hoping to hear back on the rental here in a couple of days, it would be nice to lock that down so we can give our current landlord notice about when we are leaving. He's been great, he understands why we are leaving, and has been very willing to work with us as we look for something else. </p> <p>After looking at the houses, we drove around Half Moon Bay a bit, realizing it was much larger and nicer than we had originally thought. It's about 14 miles door to door from the place we want to get, and the office, so that shouldn't be too bad a drive every day, assuming traffic doesn't bite me!</p> <p>From there we went to the mall for pictures with the Easter Bunny. Here's the result</p> <p><a title="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5647907247/"><img alt="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5221/5647907247_533bcc1a03_t.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a>&nbsp;<a title="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5647906275/"><img alt="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5267/5647906275_0f0d91c46a_t.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a>&nbsp;<a title="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5647905349/"><img alt="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5310/5647905349_b6660afa85_t.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a>&nbsp;<a title="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5647904369/"><img alt="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5269/5647904369_26c605bbc5_t.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a>&nbsp;<a title="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5648465898/"><img alt="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5067/5648465898_1eb483f02f_t.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a>&nbsp;<a title="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5647902359/"><img alt="Jacqueline and the Easter Bunny" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5108/5647902359_72bc259d58_t.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a>&nbsp;<a title="Jacqueline before the Easter Bunny" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5648464158/"><img alt="Jacqueline before the Easter Bunny" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5229/5648464158_7b94d60c19_t.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a>&nbsp;<a title="Jacqueline before the Easter Bunny" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5647900737/"><img alt="Jacqueline before the Easter Bunny" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5110/5647900737_d37dd3a762_t.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a></p>
