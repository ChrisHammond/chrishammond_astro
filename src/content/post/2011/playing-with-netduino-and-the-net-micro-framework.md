<p>I’m playing around with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XT25TY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B003XT25TY" target="_blank">Netduino</a> a little bit tonight. I ordered a couple of months ago from Amazon, and haven’t had the time/energy to do anything with it until tonight.</p>  <p>That finally changed though, I was shocked how easy it was to get going with it. Basically here were the steps to get started: (I followed the instructions and steps from <a href="https://netduino.com/downloads/">https://netduino.com/downloads/</a>)</p>  <ol>   <li>Install Visual Studio 2010 (that was already done due to my <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> work) </li>    <li>Install the .Net Micro Framework SDK V4.1 </li>    <li>Install the Netduino SDK </li>    <li>Create a Visual Studio Project (Micro Framework/Arduino Project) </li>    <li>Add a couple of lines of code (found in the <a href="https://netduino.com/downloads/gettingstarted.pdf" target="_blank">Getting Started Guide</a>) </li> </ol>  <p>It was pretty darn easy.</p>  <p>I grabbed an LED from my collection of electronic stuff (all of which hasn’t been used yet!) and hooked it up as well, I was quickly able to turn it on or off as well (the getting started tutorial shows you how to turn on/off the onboard LED).</p>  <p>I’m looking forward to doing more with the Netduino over the next few months, though I still think I need to come up with a good project that I need it for, something that it solves a problem for, I’ve got a few ideas in terms of how I might use it in the <a href="https://www.project350z.com" target="_blank">Project 350z</a>, but we’ll see, that may be a bit far off.</p>
