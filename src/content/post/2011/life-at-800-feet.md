<p>I went for a walk/hike today, taking my Garmin Forerunner 305 and my phone with me running SportsTrackLive.com. It’s definitely overkill to have both the garmin and the phone tracking my trip, but interesting to compare the data to see how the match or differ.</p>  <p>Making it home both devices say we live right around 800’, that’s quite a change from Parker Colorado where we were at 6k feet or so, but consider I work at a building that is at or near sea level and it is only a few miles away.</p>  <p>Here’s a video of the clouds rolling in on the hills north of us.</p> <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="225" data="https://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=7e27cd26db&amp;photo_id=4785982364"></param> <param name="movie" value="https://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="https://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=7e27cd26db&photo_id=4785982364" height="225" width="400"></embed></object>  <p>There are some downfalls to living up here in the hills, and in the clouds.</p>  <p><strong>Gas      <br /></strong>Climbing up the hills every day in the cars/trucks causes a big hit in gas mileage, and while you get to coast downhill a lot when you leave, you don’t make up all the fuel spent coming up. That was one of the main reasons for getting rid of the F-250, it got around 11mpg around town because of the trip home. The Z gets 17mpg if lucky, which is also around where the CX-7 is.</p>  <p><strong>Clouds</strong>     <br />Living in the clouds sounds cool right? Well it is, makes for some great scenery some times, but it also makes for wet cars 75% of the year! Wet cars are dirty cars.</p>  <p><strong>Trees</strong>     <br />I’ve always said I wouldn’t buy a house with a Tree next to the driveway, and I didn’t when we purchased in Colorado. But here we are again in a rental home, and what towers over the driveway? A damn tree. It’s losing leaves left and right, that in combination with the water from the clouds makes for extremely dirty cars, and now pollen season seems to be starting as well. My Blue 350z is pretty much green nowadays.</p>  <p>I think we are going to park the cars on the street here pretty soon, I’m sick of the filth!</p>
