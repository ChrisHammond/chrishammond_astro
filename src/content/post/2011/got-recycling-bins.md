excerpt: "Half Moon Bay must be crazy about recycling. We now have three (3) 65 gallon trash cans dedicated for recycling. We don’t have a service provided trash can, and we have a 96 gallon yard waste bin. Two of the recycling bins were delivered today. One was delivered on Tuesday. Hello? Why so much? I mean, I imagine we could actually use two, but three, no way in hell.  I’m going to have to call Allied Waste tomorrow and sort this mess out. I still have to get rid of all our boxes as well, hopefully I’ll get them posted on Craigslist tonight and get someone to come pick them up."
