<p>If you didn’t hear the news, <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/EntryId/3158/DotNetNuke-6-0-1-Released.aspx">DotNetNuke 6.0.1 was released yesterday, check out Joe’s blog post for more details</a>.</p>  <p>On that note, I put out two new open source releases as well. I updated <a href="https://dnnsimplearticle.codeplex.com" target="_blank">DNNSimpleArticle</a> with a fix for DNN6 and made made a few other minor changes. As always, the module is released in C# and you can get the installable package, or the source package over on <a href="https://dnnsimplearticle.codeplex.com/">https://dnnsimplearticle.codeplex.com/</a>. If you want to see the module in action check out <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/">https://www.bicycletips.com/</a> </p>  <p>I also released an update for <a href="https://multifunction.codeplex.com/">Multifunction, the World’s Best Free DotNetNuke Skin</a>. It has a minor CSS fix for DNN6 (and 6.0.1). I also removed the custom actions menu it was using in favor of the new <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> 6 specific actions menu. MultiFunction is a C# skin, with both install and source packages available from <a href="https://multifunction.codeplex.com/">https://multifunction.codeplex.com/</a></p>  <p>Be sure to rate both releases when you download!</p>
