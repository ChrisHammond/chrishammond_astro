<p>In the morning Natalie and I are planning on a bike ride. We’re going to ride in McNee Ranch State Park. We’re going to try to ride to the top of the mountain. Almost 1900’ from essentially sea level.</p>  <p><a href="https://bahiker.com/southbayhikes/mcneeranch.html" target="_blank">Here’s the writeup from BAHiker.com</a>, though it appears to be about 10 years old now</p>  <p>I’m not sure how that is going to go over, but we are going to try! Wish us luck.</p>
