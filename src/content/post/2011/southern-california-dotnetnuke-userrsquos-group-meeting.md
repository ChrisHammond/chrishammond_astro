<p>Tonight I went to the Southern California <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> User’s Group. It was a great meeting. Darcy from DocVerify.com presented a very good presentation/discussion on how to speed websites up. Not in particular DotNetNuke websites, but everything covered related to DNN.</p>  <p>Check out his website, it is pretty darn fast <a href="https://www.docverify.com">www.docverify.com</a></p>
