<p>So I did it, (with the help of Natalie). I made it to 50 miles on the bike this week. Actually 52.36 miles according to Garmin Connect. I rode 4 out of the last 7 days, I hope to try to keep that up, at least 3 out of 7 days at minimum. My average speed for the 52 miles was 10mph, (including stops for photos) with an average heart rate of 159bpm.</p>  <p>This was over a total of 5 hours, 13 minutes, and an average cadence of 61rpm according to the Garmin. It says I burned 4036 calories, though I don‚Äôt know how accurate the calorie estimates are for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSWCQA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B000CSWCQA" target="_blank">Forerunner 305</a> that I use.</p>  <p>So, I will set the goal again, another 50 miles starting tomorrow. We‚Äôll see how that goes, I have a feeling getting 50 miles in this coming week will be more difficult.</p>
