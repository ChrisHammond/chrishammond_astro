No, while I am posting this message here, we aren't moving to Colorado any time soon. But I will post it here now. But I do greatly miss the wonderful state of Colorado, and I envision being back there again.<br /> <p>I just need to convince Natalie that Colorado is where we want to go after California....Â </p>
