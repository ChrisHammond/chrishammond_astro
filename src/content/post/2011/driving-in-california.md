<p>After a team building event tonight after work I was taking <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/tabid/825/BlogID/239/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Will Strohl</a> home, driving on Woodside we saw a Delorean driving down the road. I think I’ve seen one on the road before, but I couldn’t tell you when.</p>  <p>We were on Woodside road, the same road I saw my first Hell’s Angel on. </p>  <p>You see things in California you definitely wouldn’t see in Missouri!</p>
