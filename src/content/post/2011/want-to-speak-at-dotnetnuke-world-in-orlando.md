<p>If you are interested in presenting a session (or three) at <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/News/Events/DotNetNuke-World-2011.aspx" target="_blank">DotNetNuke World in Orlando</a> in November time is running out to get your <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/News/Events/DotNetNuke-World-2011/DotNetNuke-World-2011-Speaker-Submission.aspx" target="_blank">sessions submitted</a>!</p>  <p>You have until June 8th to get them in. Even if you haven’t spoken at a DotNetNuke Conference in the past we are looking for new talent, new ideas, and new topics!</p>  <p>So head on over to the <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/News/Events/DotNetNuke-World-2011/DotNetNuke-World-2011-Speaker-Submission.aspx" target="_blank">speaker submission page</a> and get started, obviously the more sessions you submit the better your chances are for being picked!</p>  <p><strong>DotNetNuke World is November 9th through 11th, 2011</strong>, and will be held in Orlando Florida. What happened to DotNetNuke Connections? Well, while doing the conference in Las Vegas the past few years, we’ve grown up, and it’s time to do our own show! Having our own show, and having it in Orlando offers a lot of benefits. 1) It’s far cheaper for you to attend compared to Las Vegas. 2) it is easily accessible for our <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> user’s in Europe. 3) You can easily turn it into a family vacation, as I hear there are a few things that families might be interested in around there.</p>  <p><a href="https://bit.ly/DnnTraining" target="_blank"><strong>DotNetNuke Training</strong></a></p>  <p>We will once again have some pre-conference training available, the topics and registration information for those will be announced within the next couple of weeks.</p>
