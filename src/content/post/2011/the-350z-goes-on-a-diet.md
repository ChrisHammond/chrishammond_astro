On Saturday the 350z went on a diet, losing (rough guess here) about 3% of it’s total weight.  When I purchased the car in January of 2010 I knew a few things. The stereo in the car was aftermarket, and so were the two 10” subs in the back of the car. Beyond that I also assumed there was an amplifier somewhere powering the subs, but I wasn’t really sure what else there was. <a href="https://www.autocrossblog.com/the-350z-goes-on-a-diet">Read More at www.autocrossblog.com</a>
