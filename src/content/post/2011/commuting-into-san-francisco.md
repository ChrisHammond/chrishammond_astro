<p>The past two days I’ve been commuting into San Francisco in the mornings to conduct some onsite <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com"><a href="https://bit.ly/DnnTraining" target="_blank">DotNetNuke Training</a> for</a> a customer of ours. Rather than try to drive in and find a parking place downtown I took the Caltrain in from the San Carlos Station. Having only taken the CalTrain to the Milbrae station previously and then taking Bart the rest of the way in I wasn’t sure what to expect.</p>  <p>The train left the SC station and I arrived at the client location (after hoping on a Muni bus) in less than 40 minutes! Pretty damn sweet for a cost of about $13/day ($9 for the caltrain day pass and then $2 for the Muni).</p>  <p>Tonight coming home however it was a little more difficult. I managed to miss the Muni ride after I was done, so I had to wait around for the next one. I still managed to make a Caltrain that left the station in SF at 5;27pm. I think I finally got off the train though in San Carlos around 6:40pm, much longer than my trip in. We ended up getting delayed for some reason due to &quot;mechanical difficulties” on a train in front of us.</p>  <p>I don’t think I would like to make that trip every day, but for the past two days it was a nice little change of pace from my 9 mile commute I usually have every morning.</p>
