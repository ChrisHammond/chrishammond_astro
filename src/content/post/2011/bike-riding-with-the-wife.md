This was the first time we’ve had the opportunity to go riding together. We both have bikes now, but with the baby getting away to ride is limited to one of us at a time. My brother came into town though so we stuck him with babysitting duty and headed out for a 16 mile ride around Half Moon Bay.</p>  <p>We’re looking forward to the time when we can put Jacqueline in the trailer and tow her along behind us on the bike rides! The next time we’ll get to ride together again will be in two weeks when my mother comes into town for a bit. </p>  <p><a title="IMG_2927.jpg" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5827421718/"><img border="0" alt="IMG_2927.jpg" src="https://static.flickr.com/2656/5827421718_eabc617e41_m.jpg" /></a></p>
