<p>St. Louis did something to me. Ever since I got back from STL I’ve had problems getting to sleep. I sure as heck know it isn’t because I miss it! I don’t miss the city, I do miss the friends. But I talk to most of you guys online anyways so you may as well be right here in California.</p>  <p>But, why can’t I sleep lately?</p>
