<p>So, time for a refresher. Why did we leave St. Louis?</p>  <p><a href="https://www.ourcoloradolife.com/Blog/itemId/11/The-weather-reason-number-one.aspx" target="_blank">THE WEATHER</a>!</p>  <p>That blog post is from 2008, and it describes the reason we left. Well tonight there is more news, and more reason as to why. There was apparently more major storms in the area, even a Tornado that apparently hit and caused damage to Lambert Airport.</p>  <p>While we’ve had the following here in California over the past 4-6 weeks, no damage that I know of! We also have lost power since we’ve lived here, something that happened a few times a year in Missouri.</p>  <ol>   <li>Tsunami warning</li>    <li>Earthquake</li>    <li>Thunderstorms</li>    <li>Lots of rain</li>    <li>Tornado warning</li> </ol>  <p>I still think things here in California are far better than Missouri. While we were in St. Louis in February we had ice, snow, and lots of rain. All in the period of a week.</p>
