While I’ve been in the ecosystem for DotNetNuke since the beginning, I wasn’t employed by DNN Corp until 3/1/2010. So today marks the anniversary of my first day here. It’s been a heck of a year! I can’t even begin to list off all the things that have happened in the past year, but I will try to list off a few of them (with links to the obligatory blog post where appropriate).  <div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/tabid/825/CatID/16/Default.aspx>Community</a></div><div class="category">Category: <a href=https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/tabid/825/CatID/15/Default.aspx>DotNetNuke Corporation</a></div><img src="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dnndaily/~4/TXT5Qs7JaHI" height="1" width="1"/>
