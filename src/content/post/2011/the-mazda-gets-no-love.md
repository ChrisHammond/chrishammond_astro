<p>I can't believe it, but tonight after work I came home and washed, rain-x'd and waxed the Mazda CX-7. We've owned it since December, and this is the first time I've put wax on it.</p>  <p>I'm so ashamed, I don't know if I have ever owned a car (<a href="https://www.project240z.com/">besides the 240z</a>) that ever went that long without getting waxed. Even the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5389647720/">Turbobird</a> got waxed and it was a huge mess.</p>  <p>The CX-7 was a mess, as is the <a href="https://www.project350z.com/">350z</a> right now. One of the downfalls of living in Half Moon Bay, if you don't park your cars in the garage (we don't currently have room) they WILL be wet almost every morning.</p>  <p>Perhaps this weekend I can get the garage cleaned and come up with room for at least one of the cars.</p>
