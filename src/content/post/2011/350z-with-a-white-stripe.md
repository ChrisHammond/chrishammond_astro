excerpt: "I was looking around at Flickr today and happened to check out my &quot;photo stats&quot;. The most viewed photo for the day (having just started according to the Flickr servers) was this photo    I kind of liked the white stripe on my old 350z. I’m still thinking I will wrap this one, but the stripe got me reminiscing.  What do you think of the stripe? Yay or nay? Add a comment below and let me know!  You can find a number of photos of the car during the striping process at 350z White Stripe"
