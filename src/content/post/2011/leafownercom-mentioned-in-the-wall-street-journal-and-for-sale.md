If you've read the latest article from Michael Ramsey in the Wall Street Journal you may have noticed that LeafOwner.com was mentioned! Big thanks to Michael for taking the time to setup a phone call and interview me (Chris Hammond) for his article.<br /> <br /> I don't know if the article will be made public or not, right now it's available to subscribers only unless you find it through Google News (though that only works some of the time apparently based on my testing).<br /> <br /> Here's a screenshot of the original article (only the section mentioning LeafOwner as I don't want to reproduce the entire article).<br /> <br /> <img alt="" src="https://www.leafowner.com/Portals/0/Images/Marketing/wsj.PNG" /><br /> <br /> And a link to the article itself<br /> <br /> <a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704662604576202472052731388.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001...</a><br /> <br /> If you are interested in purchasing LeafOwner.com, shoot me an email info at leafowner.com<br />
