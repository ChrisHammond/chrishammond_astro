<p><a href="https://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/483/Unable-to-get-any-customer-service-from-Injen-Syst.aspx" target="_blank">So a while back now I complained</a> that I wasn’t able to get any customer service from Injen Systems on the Super SES exhaust that was on my 350z when I purchased it.</p>  <p>Well I am happy to say that I no longer have that problem! Injen contacted me and apologized for the lack of responses previously. I was still somewhat cautious, but they did say that they could help me by sending me the parts I needed to fix the leaking system (at a cost, but I didn’t expect them for free).</p>  <p>The parts showed up today! So, to Injen, thank you for your help!</p>  <p>I’ll be installing the exhaust this weekend, taking the OEM setup back out. I’ll have to try to weigh everything before I put it in, and then the OEM one when it comes out to compare.</p>  <p>On an unrelated note to the exhaust. In the 2011 February Fastrack the SCCA is proposing moving the 350z from BSP to ESP. I’m  going to have to write a letter, or 3, in support of that move!</p> <a href="https://www.autocrossblog.com/injen-customer-service-update-it-rocks">Read More at www.autocrossblog.com</a>
