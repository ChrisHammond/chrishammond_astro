excerpt: "For today’s blog post (Day 57 of 2011) I was going to write a blog post on my phone, but I wanted an app to do it with. Well guess what? There don’t appear to be any apps in the Android Market that support MetaWeblog API, which is what this blog (running on Engage: Publish) uses for remote publishing.  I did find a reference to a project on code.google.com called Mobilogger, but after some testing I am not even going to bother linking to it as the application is far from complete and useful at this point.  So here I sit, writing a blog post from Windows Live Writer on my laptop. Perhaps now that my course is done I should really look into writing an&#160; Android application, and maybe a blogging app would be a good place to start? hmmmm"
