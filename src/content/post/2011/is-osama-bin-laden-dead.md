excerpt: "It looks like Barrack Obama may be announcing tonight that Osama&#160; Bin Laden is dead!  One can only hope that this is true and he does announce it this evening.  I was in a hotel the morning of 9/11 watching the attacks on the World Trade Center happen. Kind of fitting I am sitting in a hotel here tonight as this news breaks."
