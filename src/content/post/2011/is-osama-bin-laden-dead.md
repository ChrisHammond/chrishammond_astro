<p>It looks like Barrack Obama may be announcing tonight that Osama&#160; Bin Laden is dead!</p>  <p>One can only hope that this is true and he does announce it this evening.</p>  <p>I was in a hotel the morning of 9/11 watching the attacks on the World Trade Center happen. Kind of fitting I am sitting in a hotel here tonight as this news breaks.</p>
