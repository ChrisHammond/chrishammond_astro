So far the weather here in California this year has been great! While a little wet, the temperature has been just the way I like it. Today started out wet, but ended nice and sunny here in Half Moon Bay, temperature in the low 60s, maybe even mid 50s. <br /> I headed off to try and catch the sunset, though it didn't turn out to be a great color show. Tomorrow we're going to test out our new BBQ, in prep for a gathering we are having next week.
