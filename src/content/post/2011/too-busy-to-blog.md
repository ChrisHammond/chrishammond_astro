<p>Seriously, where does the time go? I get home from work, spend some time with the family, eat dinner, start working and next thing I know it’s 10pm.</p>  <p>I would write a longer blog post but I really don’t have time! I’m going to study now and get my final assignment done for my Economics of Money and Banking course so that I can get the final requested and hopefully take that in the next two weeks to finish things up!</p>
