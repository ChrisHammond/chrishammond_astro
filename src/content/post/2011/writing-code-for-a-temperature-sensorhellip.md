excerpt: "So here I am, 33 years old. Writing code in C, a language I haven’t written in since college, and technically even then I used C++.  I do C# on a regular basis, but C?  I’m playing with my Nerdkit, and damn is it fun! Why? Well tonight I’m writing code for temperature sensor.  Hopefully once I figure all this out though, I will have something I can plug into my car and it will do a lot more… I’m a long way from that, but I am having fun with this. I wish I had this interest/knowledge back when I was in in college!"
