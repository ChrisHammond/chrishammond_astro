excerpt: "I see that the GoPro HD Hero2 came out with a new Firmware update on 12/15/2011. I’ve been waiting for a firmware update to enable the 3d functionality on the new cameras since I received them back in November.  I installed the Firmware update using CineForm Studio (see the steps to upgrade the firmware (as of 12/16/2011) below.  The best I can tell, this V.58 firmware update does not enable the 3D functionality on the Hero2. I spent some time playing around with it, and was unable to get the two cameras to properly sync up when connected with the sync cable. First I could only get one to boot up, but I was eventually able to get both booted after removing the sync cable and inserting it again.  I would love to try to record Christmas this year in 3d, though I doubt we’ll see another firmware update again before the end of the year. I think V.58 was released to fix some exposure issues on time lapse caused by a previous update, but I don’t know that for sure.  Hopefully in the future GoPro will take the time to post a Changelog for their Firmware updates.  Steps to upgrade GoPro HD Hero2 Firmware (follow at your own risk)     Have CineForm Studio installed on your computer    Turn off, un plug, have a full charge and SD card in the camera, have CineForm Studio off    Turn on your HD Hero2    Plug the camera into your computer via USB    Open CineForm Studio    Wait for the update available message to appear (if there is one)    Click update   Please follow the directions carefully, and check https://gopro.com/support/hd-hero2-firmware-update/ for further instructions.  I am not responsible if you damage your camera (I’ve done it before to my own camera)"
