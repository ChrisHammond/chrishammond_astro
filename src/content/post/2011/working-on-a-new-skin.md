<p>For the past few days I've been working on a new <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> skin for <a href="https://www.nataliehammond.com" target="_blank">Natalie's website</a>. I'm nearing completion on it!</p>  <p>I'm hoping to have it up over the weekend, and if all goes as planned, I'll be using the layout (with color/graphic modifications) for <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/" target="_blank">ChrisHammond.com</a> and even an overhaul of <a href="https://www.project350z.com" target="_blank">Project350z.com</a>.</p>
