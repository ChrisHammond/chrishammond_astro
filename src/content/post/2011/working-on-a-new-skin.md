excerpt: "For the past few days I've been working on a new DotNetNuke skin for Natalie's website. I'm nearing completion on it!  I'm hoping to have it up over the weekend, and if all goes as planned, I'll be using the layout (with color/graphic modifications) for ChrisHammond.com and even an overhaul of Project350z.com. "
