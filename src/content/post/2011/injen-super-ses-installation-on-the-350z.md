<p>If you followed the blog post earlier this week you already know that Injen came through and got me the replacement midpipes for my Super SES Exhaust which I removed late last year. </p><p> Today I took the OEM exhaust off the 350z and put the Injen exhaust back on. The job itself is easy, probably could do it all in about 25 minutes if I really pushed it, but I didnâ€™t. I took my time, cleaned up in the garage a bit, cleaned up the exhaust a bit as well. I also managed to weigh both the Injen exhaust and the OEM exhaust to see what the difference was. I was hoping it would be more! </p><p> Read the full blog post for photos and video!</p> <a href="https://www.autocrossblog.com/injen-super-ses-installation-on-the-350z">Read More at www.autocrossblog.com</a>
