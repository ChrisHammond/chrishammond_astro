excerpt: "I have thought for a while now that I should do some SiteMap integration for a couple of modules, but I honestly never got around to getting it done.  Something triggered my need yesterday, and I got rolling with things rather quickly. Chris Paterra has a great post on how to implement a sitemap for your modules, I ended up implementing one for the DNNSimpleArticle module which powers the homepage of Solo2.org and SCCAForums.com. I also implemented it for the module that powers ChrisHammond.com, Project350z.com and DomoticsBlog.com  The basics are pretty straight forward for getting a SiteMap integrated with your custom modules. I won't recreate Chris' blog post here, but basically you need to create a new class, and populate a list of SiteMapUrls. Depending on your module, and it's content, that may or may not be difficult.  I think I'm going to implement the sitemap for the next release of the Wiki module, should be fairly straight forward. "
