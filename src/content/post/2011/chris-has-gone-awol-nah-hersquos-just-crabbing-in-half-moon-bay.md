<p>So if you are anything like my mother you probably are wondering what the heck has Chris been up to lately? Well, I am not AWOL, just busy!</p>  <p>I spent last week in Lincoln Nebraska at the SCCA Solo National Championships, what's that? Car racing. How'd I do? eh, not worth mentioning where I actually finished, but I did get to see friends I haven't seen since Nationals in 2008, the last time I attended. I couldn't really believe that I hadn't been since 2008, but that is the truth, with the move to Colorado in 2009 and then California in 2010 I just didn't get to go. I'll have more blog posts/videos/photos from Solo Nationals in the coming week.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/6115289932/" title="Day 247 of #Baby365 by chrishammond, on Flickr">Day 247 of #Baby365 by chrishammond, on Flickr</a> When I got back from Nationals I spent two days catching up with Natalie and <a href="https://www.jacquelinehammond.com" target="_blank">Jacqueline</a>. Sunday we headed into San Francisco to get out of Half Moon Bay and see some things. We didn&#39;t do much, but had a nice brunch in the Presidio, drove around Golden Gate Park, and walked around near Fort Mason. Here&#39;s a photo from a lookout point at the Presidio</p>  <p>This morning we went to Olivia&#39;s first birthday party in San Carlos. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157627605070436/">Check out some of the photos from the party</a>. Saturday Natalie and Jacqueline went to Sophia&#39;s birthday party as well, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157627480810879/">photos here</a>.</p>  <p>After the birthday party today we had a few folks over for a crab fest. A couple of weeks ago I had a crab dinner at a local restaurant and was kind of grumpy that I paid $22+ for half a pound of crab, so I decided that we should have our own crab dinner at our house. We had the Strohls (4), Jeff Seeling (1) and Heyward and Julia (2) over for dinner tonight. I picked up some crab from the Half Moon Bay Safeway. It was $7/lb, cooked, cracked and cleaned. I had gone to the Half Moon Bay Fish Market on Sunday to see how much it was there, I thought it was a good deal at $10/lb cooked/cleaned. I am glad that I went to Safeway this morning before the party to check things out though, the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/half-moon-bay-fish-market-half-moon-bay">Yelp reviews for the Fish Market</a> made me start to have second thoughts. Safeway turned out to be great for this dinner.</p>  <p>Basically we took the crab from Safeway, put it into foil lined and covered pans with a small amount of water in them, and put them on the grill for 6-9 minutes. I think they turned out great. We had 5 crabs, probably 12 lbs total, and it seemed to cover the 8 of us, though I think only 5 or 6 of us actually ate crab, in the future I'll likely do 1 per person if we do this again. I only took 2 photos tonight, was too busy cleaning and having a good time with friends!</p>  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/6119334580/" title="Crab dinner">Crab dinner</a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/6118789173/" title="Crab dinner">Crab dinner</a></p>  <p>This week I have a lot of catching up to do on work! It was great to have the week off, but I feel like I am now way behind at the office!</p>
