<p>This was supposed to be our final day of moving, 2 of 2, now it is 2 of 3.</p>  <p>This morning Macy Movers showed up with one truck, they informed me that the larger truck broke down (lost the clutch) climbing the hill to our place in San Carlos. So they were not going to be able to load everything up today <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" alt="Sad smile" src="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//windows-live-writer/fac2547e17b7_13188/wlemoticon-sadsmile_2.png" /></p>  <p>They ended up getting another truck, but smaller than the one they had, so we brought two truckloads over to the house today. We’ll head back over tomorrow and hopefully finish up fairly quickly.</p>  <p>So far the new house is great! The dogs love the backyard, and Jacqueline is spending her first night in her own room. So far so good! I wonder if Mommy will get any sleep?</p>  <p>Here’s a video of Jacqueline earlier in the week showing off her rolling skills for the camera</p> <iframe height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2Ed_dN781U?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
