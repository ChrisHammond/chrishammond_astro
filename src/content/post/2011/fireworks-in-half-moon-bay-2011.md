<p>So I was doing a little digging and according to the Half Moon Bay Review (<a href="https://www.hmbreview.com">www.hmbreview.com</a>) it looks like there will be a Fireworks show in Half Moon Bay this year at Pillar Point. </p>  <p>Now, the question is, will there be a “good” way to get to watch them, and not get swamped in traffic? Something tells me that is unlikely. Though perhaps we can walk to the beach (1 mile) and catch them from there? </p>  <p><a href="https://www.hmbreview.com/news/article_24336cae-9d27-11e0-a129-001cc4c03286.html">https://www.hmbreview.com/news/article_24336cae-9d27-11e0-a129-001cc4c03286.html</a></p>
