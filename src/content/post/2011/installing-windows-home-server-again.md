<p>So it’s been a while since I’ve actually used my Windows Home Server, for the past year or so I have had some troubles with it, so ultimately I ditched it and went with just a single external hard drive for my files. I wasn’t too keen on the idea, but it has worked out well so far.</p>  <p>My Windows Home Server (v1) had 6 terrabytes of drive storage, so it was a shame that I wasn’t using it, but part of the reason I wasn’t is because this is how I had it setup for the past year, while it was running, and even when it wasn’t for the past few months, it looked like this.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5524877390/"><img border="0" alt="Replace this" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5019/5524877390_6c6237812e_m.jpg" width="179" height="240" /></a></p>  <p>Not exactly an ideal configuration considering we have a baby and two dogs. Fortunately the baby isn’t yet mobile, and the dogs avoided things as to not create a spaghetti incident.</p>  <p>I’m becoming paranoid about my files though, and decided it was time to have another solution in place rather than just copying the external hard drive to another external drive for a backup. So I wanted to get my WHS up and running again, but due to a variety of configuration issues I wanted to start fresh and pave the machine. I also wanted to get a drive bay to put the 4 1.5tb drives in, so I picked up a <a href="https://cjh.am/ikwEpW" target="_blank">Sans Digital 5 Bay Raid tower</a>.</p>  <p>I am going through the process now of installing WHS on my old desktop (the same machine it was on before) and while that goes, and I run windows update for I don’t know how many times, I am going to get the 6tb of drives into the new tower. I don’t expect it to be all done tonight, but I’d like to have a lot of it going so that I can get the data transfer started this week.</p>  <p>And no, I am not planning on using Windows Home Server Vail (2011) or whatever it is called, the machine I am running this on is 32bit and won’t support the latest release as far as I know (because it requires 64bit).</p>
