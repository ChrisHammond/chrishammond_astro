<p>So I have been trying to figure out how best to do this blog post for a while now, though I think I will be better off doing it as a series of blog posts rather than one individual one. So this post will be the starting point for the conversion. I will update it with links to the other blog posts in the series as they get created and added.</p> <p><strong>Background </strong><em>(all in my opinion and based on my memory, as inaccurate as that may be)</em>:</p> <p>Back in the early days of ASP.NET there were a few projects that many asp.net developers tried to use. There was a forum project at the time managed by Rob Howard at Microsoft, the ASP.NET Forums. There was a blog project called .Text and a photo gallery called nGallery.</p> <p>Ultimately Rob left Microsoft and formed a company called Telligent, he took the ASP.NET Forums, and worked with the owners of the nGallery and .Text to merge them all into a product from Telligent called CommunityServer. CommunityServer progressed over the years, and a number of websites have been built with it. I believe <a href="https://www.asp.net">www.asp.net</a> once ran on CommunityServer, and I had a number of websites of my own that ran on it at one time. I don't believe <a href="https://www.asp.net">www.asp.net</a> still runs on it, at least 100% but some forms of CommunityServer are still in use as seen by visiting the blogs at <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net">https://weblogs.asp.net</a> including my own at <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc">https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc</a>.</p> <p>Initially CommunityServer was called &ldquo;open source&rdquo; and veiled under that banner, but over time that changed and it became what most would consider a very expensive piece of software. Over the past 6 months I have seen a lot of interest in converting off of CommunityServer</p> <p><strong>My history with CommunityServer</strong></p> <p>My background with CommunityServer begins before it started, I worked with the ASP.NET Forums project, and became (remain) good friends with one of the very first Telligent employees. I've had a number of websites that ran on .Text and CommunityServer throughout the years. My personal website ran on it, I had a few racing websites on it as well. As of late <a href="https://www.sccaforums.com/">https://www.sccaforums.com/</a> ran on it, though at the end of November 2010 I converted it over to <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a>. This series of blog posts will document all that was necessary for that conversion.</p> <p>I've been using DotNetNuke since it was known as IBuySpy Workshop. I work for the DotNetNuke Corporation now. So it made sense for me to convert from CommunityServer to DotNetNuke.</p> <p>When I converted moved from CommunityServer 2.1 to DotNetNuke 5.6.0 and the DotNetNuke Forum Module version 5.0. I did make a few customizations to the Forum module and I will talk about those.</p> <p><strong>What's Coming</strong></p> <p>Here are some of the things that need to be covered in the conversion. I will link these posts as they are written, and also add to the list as I find other info to be covered.</p> <ul>     <li>Installing DotNetNuke and background </li>     <li>Converting Users (hashed passwords) </li>     <li>Converting Forum Groups </li>     <li>Converting Forums </li>     <li>Converting Forum Threads </li>     <li>Converting Forum Replies </li>     <li>Implementing BB Code in DNN Forum Module </li>     <li>Customizing the DotNetNuke Banner SkinObject </li>     <li>Handling CommunityServer URLs and sending them to DotNetNuke </li> </ul> <p>Series of Posts:   <br /> <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33060/Converting-From-CommunityServer-to-DotNetNuke-Intr.aspx">Part 1: An Introduction</a>    <br /> <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33098/CommunityServer-to-DotNetNuke-Part-2-DotNetNuke-I.aspx">Part 2: DotNetNuke Installation</a>    <br /> <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33102/Part-3-Converting-users-from-CommunityServer-to-D.aspx">Part 3: Converting users from CommunityServer to DotNetNuke</a>    <br /> <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33114/Part-4-Getting-the-conversion-tables-ready-for-CS.aspx">Part 4: Getting the conversion tables ready for CS&nbsp; to DNN</a>    <br /> <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33123/Part-5-Moving-Forum-threads-from-CommunityServer.aspx" target="_blank">Part 5: Moving Forum threads from CommunityServer to DotNetNuke</a><br /> <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33327/Part-6-Community-Server-to-DotNetNuke-Moving-Foru">Part 6, Community Server to DotNetNuke Moving Forum replies and attachments</a><br /> <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33750/Part-7-CommunityServer-to-DotNetNuke-handling-URL">Part 7: CommunityServer to DotNetNuke handling URLs</a></p>
