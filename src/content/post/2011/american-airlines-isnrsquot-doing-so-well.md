<p>Sunday when I was getting ready to come back, I got an automated call from AA telling me that my flight was cancelled. They fortunately rescheduled me through Dallas instead of Chicago and I made it home, later than initially planned, but at least I made it home.</p>  <p>Today, Natalie and the baby get to the airport in STL and find out that their flight to LA then SFO is cancelled. So they also get routed through Dallas. They were supposed to be home 3 hours ago, and they are still not scheduled (due to consistent delays) to actually arrive at SFO until almost 11pm tonight.</p>  <p>Thanks American Airlines. Now that my frequent flier miles are used up I think I will ditch using your airline and use one that actually has flights.</p>
