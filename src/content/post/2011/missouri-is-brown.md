<p>On our trip yesterday we flew to Chicago, then down from Chicago to St. Louis. As with a lot of flights into St. Louis there were a ton of recruits on the flight making their way down to Fort Leonard Wood. Two of them were girls, sitting in the row behind us. First things first, I respect anyone who commits to our nation’s military, and I applaud them for doing so.</p>  <p>That being said, holy cow&#160; are we in trouble. The first 30 minutes of the 1 hour flight were spent with each of them trying to show how dumb they were when it came to geography. Neither of them knew where Missouri was, and I’m sure you could have asked them where ANY other state was (besides Connecticut or Wisconsin where they were from) and they wouldn’t have a clue where they were on a map.</p>  <p>I tried to tune them out, and Jacqueline tried to drown them out with a little bit of crying, but it was hard to do. The best part, or worst, was when we finally came down out of the clouds and were about to land in St. Louis. They both looked out the window and commented on how “crappy” Missouri looked” I wanted to turn around and say “welcome to winter, if you aren’t covered in snow and white, this is what the rest of the country looks like at this time of year”.&#160; But I didn’t, I chose to let it go.</p>  <p>But I must admit, they are right, it sure is brown here! A totally different kind of brown than Colorado was, and much different than California is. It is rather desolate looking.</p>
