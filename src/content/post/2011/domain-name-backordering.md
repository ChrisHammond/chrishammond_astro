excerpt: "Within the past week or two I started getting notifications that a version of a domain name that I owned was available for purchase. I’ve owned the .ORG for the domain name for 5 years or so now, but the .COM was taken (not being used).  These notifications that I started receiving were for the .COM version, and made it sound like they owned the domain and I could purchase it from them. I probably got 5 or 6 different versions of this email, from different people, so I started wondering what was going on. I figured out that the .COM version of the domain was actually expired though not yet released.  So I checked on Godaddy, and I had a backorder credit that hadn’t been used yet, so I setup the backorder for this .COM domain name that was coming up for deletion. The domain went into the “pendingDelete” state which usually lasts 5 days. This morning the domain was officially deleted  Godaddy came through and acquired the domain for me. So, now I am thinking. Should I email back the spammers who said they could get the domain for me and say “Thanks for the heads up”"
