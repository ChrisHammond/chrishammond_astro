<p>Is Android@Home vaporware? That is the question I have been asking myself since Google announced Android@Home at Google IO earlier this week.</p>  <p>There isn’t a whole lot of information out there as of right now, as to what Android@Home actually is, will be, or wants to be. The details are very sparse. The only information with any sort of a timeline that I’ve been able to find is <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/digital-home/android-home-what-you-need-to-know-955045" target="_blank">an article from TechRadar</a> that says the first “product” will be due at the end of this year (2011).</p>  <p>I’m hoping that things will flush out from Google over the next few months. In the mean time I think it is time that I dive into some Android development. I’ve been meaning to do so for quite some time, but with everything else going on I haven’t had the opportunity. </p>  <p>If you recall my last blog post you’ll see that I’ve dumb’d down the house, so this announcement from Google about Android@Home might have come at just the right time for me. Is it time to ditch Insteon and move to something else? Only time will tell.</p>
