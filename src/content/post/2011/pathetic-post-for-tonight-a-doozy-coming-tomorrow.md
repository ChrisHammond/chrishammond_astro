excerpt: "So, just so I keep up with my posts for the year I submit this pathetic post. I don’t have much to say as I’m working on a post for tomorrow that is SURE to ruffle some feathers, a ton of feathers if you’re a greeny I am sure!  So in place of a real blog post for today, I offer you a photo of me and my daughter from yesterday.  "
