excerpt: "So I noticed in my Hotmail account (which I only check to see if I get other people’s email) that Bing recently “updated” their Webmaster tools.  So, the question is, does anyone use it? Is Bing at all relevant? I jumped on the Bingwagon when it first came out, then I quickly realized it never indexed any of my websites, while Google ate them up and showed me in search results.   Should I bother setting up my sites in their webmaster tools? Or should I just stick with Google?"
