<p>So today I did some testing with UStream and the FM Audio Broadcast at the El Toro ProSolo. I think I managed to come up with a way to broadcast the announce stream out on the internet (audio only) using UStream.</p>  <p>I setup a new &ldquo;Channel&rdquo; for the ProSolo on Ustream, we'll see how it works out tomorrow, but if you want, give it a listen by going to (only active during competition, and if it works)</p>  <p>[LINK REMOVED]</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>This is completely unofficial, and if it goes down it goes down, no promises that it will work!</p>  <p>Between the live audio and <a href="https://sololive.scca.com">https://sololive.scca.com</a> you might be able to feel like you are actually in El Toro being miles away! The event is supposed to start at 9am, we'll see how things work out.</p>
