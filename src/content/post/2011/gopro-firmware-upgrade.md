<p>So if you read my postings a month or two ago you know I had trouble with the GoPro firmware last time around. Ended up bricking the camera and having to send it in.</p>  <p>Much better luck tonight! I got V 1.1.5 upgraded without any trouble. I wasn’t sure what the camera had on it that they sent me in exchange for my repair, so I wanted to make sure I was on the latest firmware for the trip to San Diego. I’m hoping to timelapse the drive.</p>  <p>We’ll see if the batteries (2 of them) last the trip, I doubt it, but we’ll see. I have the camera set for shooting every 5 seconds and plan to mount it facing out the windshield.</p>  <p>Thanks for all of you who “like” <a href="https://facebook.com/project350z" target="_blank">Project350z on Facebook</a>! We’ve seen some good growth the past couple of days!</p> <a href="https://www.autocrossblog.com/gopro-firmware-upgrade">Read More at www.autocrossblog.com</a>
