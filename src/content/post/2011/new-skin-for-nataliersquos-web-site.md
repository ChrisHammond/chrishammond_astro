<p>So for the past week or so I’ve been working on a new skin for Natalie’s website. Well I have uploaded it and applied it to the site. I’ve got a bit more work left to do, minor styling tweaks, some additional graphics, and updating/organizing more content, but check out the work in progress and let me know what you think!</p>  <p><a href="https://www.nataliehammond.com/">https://www.nataliehammond.com/</a></p>
