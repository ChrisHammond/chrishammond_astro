excerpt: "So here we are, it’s Friday, Day 7 of the Twenty Eleven.  This will be a brief blog post, but hey, it’s Friday night!  I’ve made it 7 days into 2011 and blogged each of the first 7 days, only 358 more days to go? I’ve also managed to keep up with the photo/day thing.  Check out my Flickr365 photos posted so far  and of course Jacqueline’s Baby365 as well!"
