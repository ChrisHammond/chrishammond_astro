excerpt: "I really wish I kept track of these things, so here it goes.  Today is May 11, 2011, I had a Seagate 2TB external hard drive fail today. It actually probably failed yesterday or before, but I just noticed it today. Prior to this I’ve had 2 750gb hard drives (both Seagates) fail on me. These previous failures occurred some time in the fall of 2009.  Fortunately for me the 2tb hard drive had recently been wiped clean (After backing up all the data to my Windows Home Server) except for my music that was being served through my Zune software. Fortunately any of the music that was on this drive is either a) already backed up on the WHS, or should be downloadable again through Zune.  I think I’m officially done with buying any Seagate hard drives ever again.  This one is going back under warranty, but I doubt I’ll trust it for much in the future when it gets returned. Hopefully this is the last blog post I ever make about Seagate Hard Drives failing…."
