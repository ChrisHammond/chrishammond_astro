<p>Today Natalie and I, along with Will Strohl and Kim Rausch (and kids), went to the Travis AFB Air Show, the weather was great, if a little windy. As we were walking around after the Thunderbirds show, taking photos and getting ready to leave I came across this spot on the tarmac</p>  <p><a title="B-1 Bomber/Retirement Location" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5992909138/"><img border="0" alt="B-1 Bomber/Retirement Location" src="https://static.flickr.com/6124/5992909138_b95f160d33.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>As we walked by that painted pavement I realized I had been there before.</p>  <p><a title="psn00053" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/2047151431/"><img border="0" alt="psn00053" src="https://static.flickr.com/2376/2047151431_84d077fc2e.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>That was where my dad retired after 30 years in the United States Air Force.</p>  <p><a title="Retirement Ceremony" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/2047155387/"><img border="0" alt="Retirement Ceremony" src="https://static.flickr.com/2057/2047155387_392de2073f.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>The latter two photos were taken with my first digital camera in March of 1998.</p>  <p>Iâ€™m a proud son!</p>
