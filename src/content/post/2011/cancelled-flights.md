<p>I hope this isn’t the start of a hellacious travel day. This morning I got an automated call from American Airlines telling me that a portion of my trip today had been cancelled. Not exactly what I wanted to hear, but at least they provided me with a new booking on another flight leaving a little later, and arriving a little later.</p>  <p>Instead of flying through Chicago and then on to SFO, I’m flying through Dallas. I’m just hoping I get out of STL before the thunderstorms move in so we don’t get delayed by that somehow!</p>
