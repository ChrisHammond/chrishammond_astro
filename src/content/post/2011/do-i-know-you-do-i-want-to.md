<p>So this post is not meant to be rude, even though it might come off that way, so here it goes.</p>  <p>Do I know you? Do you know me? Do you want to know me? Do I want to know you?</p>  <p>These are questions I ask almost every day. Every time someone sends me an invitation to connect on LinkedIn, or a Facebook Friend request, or an Instant Messenger buddy list add, I wonder: Who are you? Do I know you? How do you think you know me? </p>  <p>For some people it’s easy. Yesterday I got a LinkedIn request from Natalie Hammond, that’s an easy one, my wife, though I had to think about accepting it (just kidding) I knew who it was. </p>  <p>Today I got a linked in request from another person, and for the life of me I have no clue who they are. Looking at their profile doesn’t tell me anything except their name and where they are/went to school. Other than that, no hints as to how I might know that person, or if I don’t already, why I might want to know them.</p>  <p>So a word of advice, and a small request. When you send me a LinkedIn request, or Facebook friend request, please include a brief message, remind me who you are, or intrigue me as to why I should know who you are.</p>  <p>That being said, Facebook is for friends, family, and past classmates. LinkedIn is for professional connections, so if you are a <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> user feel free to send me a LinkedIn invite (with some info about why), but don’t bother with Facebook friend requests please unless we are already friends.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrishammond">LinkedIn Profile</a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/christopherhammond">Facebook Page</a></p>  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/christoc">Twitter</a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/">Flickr</a></p>
