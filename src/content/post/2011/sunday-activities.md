excerpt: "This morning was an early morning for me and Jacqueline, I told mommy I would take morning duty so we got up just before 7 so that mommy could sleep in. We played in the play room for a while, then made our way to the office to watch some TV. We both fell asleep to Pawn Stars, and woke up to auction hunters, which is like a cross between Pawn Stars, American Pickers and Storage Wars.  Most of the rest of the day was spent cleaning up, unpacking and organizing more things. Jacqueline took a 3 hour nap during this process, convenient how she never seems to help out when we are unpacking!  We kept thinking it was going to rain, and planned to take a bike ride, and have a BBQ this afternoon. We managed to get both of those in, and it sounds like it has just started raining here in the past 15 minutes or so. I’ve got my new grill covered up, though I’m curious to see how well the cover works.  Here are some photos from today  "
