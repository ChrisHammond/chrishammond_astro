excerpt: "Tonight after work (and dinner, and baby time) I got started on my first Android application.  I’m actually doing it the “cheating” way, using Google’s App Inventor, but I figured what the hell, let’s see what I can get done in one evening. I’m not going to stay what the application is, not yet, but if I get something together I’ll see if I can’t get it into the Android Market here in the next week or so. It’s all a new experience for me, so we’ll see how this works out. "
