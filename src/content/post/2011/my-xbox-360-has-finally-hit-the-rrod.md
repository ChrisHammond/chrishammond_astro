excerpt: "It has been a good 5.5 years Xbox, I didn't play you as much as I could have, but you lasted me quite a long time for an original release day 360. Though I wish you could have given me a little bit of a heads up that you were about to pass. I was at Best Buy today and could have picked up your replacement, I gladly would have actually."

<p>It has been a good 5.5 years Xbox, I didn't play you as much as I could have, but you lasted me quite a long time for an original release day 360. Though I wish you could have given me a little bit of a heads up that you were about to pass. I was at Best Buy today and could have picked up your replacement, I gladly would have actually.</p>  <p>But tonight, you fail. The ultimate failure, Red Ring of Death. I think you may have earned yourself a place on a shelf, waiting for the day it is legal to shoot a gun in California so I can blow you to bits.</p>  <p>My Xbox was manufactured on 10/27/2005.</p>  <p>*tear*</p>
