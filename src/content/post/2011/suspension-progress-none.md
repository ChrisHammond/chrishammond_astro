excerpt: "So I didn’t make any progress today, well not much at least. I spent the morning watching the baby while the wife got to get some much needed pampering time. After that I spent time working on a work related project.  I also, with the help of my buddy Dave, figured out the additional items I needed to get so I can use the custom bushings that I blogged about yesterday.  So, Sunday is suspension day. Hopefully I can get it all done!"
