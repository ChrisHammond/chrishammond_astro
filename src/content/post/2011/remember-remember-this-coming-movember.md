excerpt: "If you follow any of my blogs, you may remember all the discussion last fall about Movember. Yes, you read that correctly, Movember, take the N in November and replace it with an M, Movember!  Why would you ever rename November to Movember? To raise awareness for cancers that affect men, primarily prostate cancer, but others as well. The basic premise of Movember is this, for the entire month, you grow a mustache. How simple is that? Start on November 1st, clean shaven, and finish on November 30th, clean shaven except for your mustache! All while raising awareness, and money for research into cancers that affect men.  The Personal Connection  Earlier this year my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer. While he is fortunate that they believe it to be caught very early there is always the risk that it can spread, He is getting ready to start the process of treatment. So obviously, my connection to Movember this year is even stronger than last year.  Movember 2010  Last year we formed a DotNetNuke team on Movember.com, which we plan to do again this year, just as soon as they open up the process. I’ll post a blog, and update this blog post as well, with a link to the team and how you can join.  We had 38 folks join the team, and a lot more donate to the cause. While not everyone who joined the team worked for DotNetNuke Corporation, a number of the members were from our offices around the world. Check out this slide show comparing some of the employees to famous Mo’s (mustaches)  Mustache presentation     View more presentations from Will Strohl    Then of course there is the fact that last year I said if I personally raised $1,000, I would shave my head at the end of the month. Well, I did, and I did.    To be honest, my wife was NOT happy about the head shaving thing, and most of the office was pretty put off by it as well! I won't be making that challenge again, not this year, but perhaps I will come up with something.  Goal for 2011  In 2010 we raised almost $7k for Movember, for 2011 we’re setting a goal of $10k, doable, but it is definitely going to take some work to get there! We’re going to need to grow our team, and we’re going to need to get everyone involved to try and raise money. I think everyone should set a goal   Getting Ready  So you have just under two months to start getting ready for Movember. Most importantly, prep your significant other for the fact that you are going to grow the mustache! If you can't grow a MO, then perhaps you can find a surrogate to do it for you!More ...Tags: Movember,DNN,Charity,DotNetNuke,Cancer,Mustache,MenCategory: CommunityCategory: DotNetNuke Corporation"
