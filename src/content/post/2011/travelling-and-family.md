<p>Part of our move to California I planned to travel less. I actually made that decision before knowing that we were having a baby, after finding that out the motivation to travel less increased.</p>  <p>Since Jacqueline was born I have definitely had less desire to travel and be away. Iâ€™ve been in Chicago for the past few days, and donâ€™t get home until Thursday. Natalie has been great with all my travels, taking care of our beautiful baby and sending me photos so I can keep up with #Baby365!</p>  <p>We are at Day 123 for the year, hereâ€™s a photo of Jacqueline and her grandpa Gra.</p>  <p><a title="Day 123 #baby365" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5686015870/"><img border="0" alt="Day 123 #baby365" src="https://static.flickr.com/5069/5686015870_46bf7df24f.jpg" /></a></p>
