<p><a title="Maker Shield Soldering" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/6058462360/"><img alt="Maker Shield Soldering" align="right" src="https://static.flickr.com/6075/6058462360_bb045b6b9a_m.jpg" style="float: right; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /></a>Back in May I picked up a variety of parts from the MakerFaire in San Mateo. One of those parts (2x actually) was the <a href="https://www.makershed.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=MSMS01">MakerShield</a>.</p> <p>I don't think I've ever soldered this much on a circuit board before. I did plenty of soldering for the <a href="https://www.project240z.com">Project 240z</a> back in the day, but it was all just joining wiring together for the Megasquirt and the fuel injection system. You can see some photos of the MakerShield here.</p> <p><a title="Maker Shield Soldering" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/6058463298/"><img alt="Maker Shield Soldering" src="https://static.flickr.com/6186/6058463298_fb5378e51d_m.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /></a>&nbsp;</p> <p>some of the soldering up close</p> <p><a title="Maker Shield Soldering" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/6057916855/"><img alt="Maker Shield Soldering" src="https://static.flickr.com/6082/6057916855_9dd877f3b6_m.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /></a>&nbsp;</p> <p>The bottom of the shield after soldering</p> <p><a title="Maker Shield Soldering" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/6057916627/"><img alt="Maker Shield Soldering" src="https://static.flickr.com/6193/6057916627_c2ffbc1d1c_m.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /></a></p> <p>So what am I going to do with that? Well, attach it to my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FRZ4E6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004FRZ4E6">Netduino Plus</a><img alt="" style="margin: 0px; border-style: none !important; border-width: 0px;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004FRZ4E6&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373" width="1" height="1" /> of course! Like so:</p> <p><a title="Maker Shield on Netduino Plus" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/6057917493/"><img alt="Maker Shield on Netduino Plus" src="https://static.flickr.com/6061/6057917493_8e3c0f00c2_m.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /></a></p> <p>But really, what am I going to do with it now? Who knows, but now that I have it together I have more options!</p> <p>I have another MakerShield to put together at some point, but right now I honestly can't see needing two right away.</p> <p>If you are looking to put together your own <a href="https://makeprojects.com/Project/How-To-Build-a-MakerShield/432/1">MakerShield, check out the directions</a> or read them right here.</p> <p><a href="https://makeprojects.com/Project/How-To-Build-a-MakerShield/432/1">How-To Build a MakerShield</a></p>
