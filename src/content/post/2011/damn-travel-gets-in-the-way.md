excerpt: "Well, there goes Day #2 of the year 2011 without a blog post. Yesterday I was planning on getting a blog post done when I got home from Vancouver, but due to my delayed flight, and not really thinking about it, I ended up not getting a blog post done for the day.  So, out of the first 193 days of 2011, I have missed two days of blogging. Not thrilled about that, but I’ll keep chugging along to see if I can make it 363 of 365 for 2011.  I did manage to get the #Baby365 photos posted however, so I’m still good to go there! "
