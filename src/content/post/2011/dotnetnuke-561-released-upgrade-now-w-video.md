<p>I won’t regurgitate all of <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryId/2946/DotNetNuke-5-6-1-Released.aspx" target="_blank">Joe Brinkman’s blog post</a> announcing the fact that <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> 5.6.1 was released today.</p>  <p>There are a couple of new features added, Razor support, and better Portal Alias handling. There are a number of bug fixes, and even some security fixes included so I would encourage you to check it out, upgrade your sites in a test environment then get your production sites upgraded.</p>  <p>If you have never upgraded a DotNetNuke website it is actually pretty darn easy to do. <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Wiki/tabid/1409/Page/Upgrading-DotNetNuke/Default.aspx">Check out some upgrade instructions in the DotNetNuke Wiki</a>, and check out the video below.</p> <strong>you should always backup the files and database before you perform maintenance on a site </strong><iframe height="481" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/15342573?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" width="601"></iframe>
