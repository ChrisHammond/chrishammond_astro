<p align="left">So last night I posted about trying to do a <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/blog/itemid/2225/restoring-from-windows-home-server-2011" target="_blank">restore of my main desktop at home using a backup from Windows Home Server 2011</a>.</p> <p>I would like to say, that after 3 hours, the restore completed, and so far, things seem to be somewhat normal. I wonder if the Adobe update caused my problem, or Windows Updates? Since the restore I’ve had trouble “rebooting” due to Windows Updates being applied. I left this morning and it was on 4 of 17, then I got home, it was still on 4 of 17 so I rebooted it. Repeated the process and it stuck on 1 of 17.</p> <p>So I rebooted it and manually ran Windows Update and installed a couple of updates, rebooted, and now it is doing 12 more.</p> <p> We’ll see how this goes, but if all this works out as well as it appears to be so far, I’m going to be moving from the release candidate of Windows Home Server 2011 to a full version! I’m sold.</p>
