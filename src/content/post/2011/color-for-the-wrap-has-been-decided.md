excerpt: "A week ago I posted a “question” on Facebook to see what color we should wrap the 350z in.   Well it looks like the final tally is 31/13/13  31 for Matte Black   13 for Matte Green    13 for Don't Do It!  So Matte Black it will be! Time to order the vinyl! I would hope to have it done by the end of the month, but realizing we are moving before then, we’ll set a goal of the end of June to have this completed. Of course we’ll have a time lapse video of the process!"
