excerpt: "I can’t wait till we buy our own house, or have one built (that would be ideal based on the topic at hand). The past couple of evenings I’ve been working on getting the TV setup in the new house, well one of the TVs. Tonight I finally got things going, the problem I’ve run into is the darn wiring. I need to get wiring for the side surround speakers, and ideally I would get rear and side speakers hooked up. Running wires for these is such a pain.  In a perfect world I would build a house with all the wiring built in as the house is put together.  Anyone have any experience with wireless speaker setups?"
