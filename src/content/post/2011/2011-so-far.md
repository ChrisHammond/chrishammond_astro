<p>So what's gone on so far in 2011? Let's recap on this 33rd day of the year.</p>  <p>So far I've kept up with my blogging commitment, every day, You can find a list of all the blogs at <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/">https://www.chrishammond.com/</a></p>  <p>i've managed to post 33 photos of myself for <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157625593520079/">#Flickr365</a> and 33 photos of Jacqueline for <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157625597966645/">#Baby365</a>. The baby is growing! She's up to 13lbs 13oz last time she was weighed and in the 95th percentile for height at her age, a jump from her last measurement.</p>  <p>I've managed to <a href="https://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/494/Autocross-Video-from-NorCalUFO-13011.aspx">autocross the 350z</a> once already this year, and have at least 2 more events coming up this month, with a possible 4th as well.</p>  <p>The Super Bowl is coming this weekend, I'm ready for it, we're going to finally get up to Fairfield and see some friends we haven't seen in probably 8 months!</p>
