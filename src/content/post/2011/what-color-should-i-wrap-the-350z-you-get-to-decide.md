excerpt: "So I’ve wanted to do this for a while, and now I’m getting ready to pull the trigger.  I am going to wrap the 350z? What does that mean? I am going to take a solid Vinyl color, and wrap it around the entire painted surface of the car. Effectively changing the color of the car, and covering the paint in a protective vinyl coating.  Why am I wrapping the car? Because I can? Or well, because I want to. I don’t know yet that I can. I’ve applied quite a bit of vinyl in my life, but never to an entire car.  Why not have someone else wrap it? Why not have a designer wrap done? Both of those options cost money, and I really would rather spend money elsewhere on the car. That being said, if you own a car wrapping business in the San Francisco Bay Area and you want to sponsor Project350z, fill out the Contact form on the About page.   What color are you going to wrap it? That’s where you come in. We’ve setup a \"Poll\" on our Facebook page, where you get to help us decide. The options are \"Matte Black, Matte Green, Don’t Do it!\" If you have a Facebook account go ahead and answer the question! The Poll will stay open until 5/4/2011.  And while you are at it, don’t forget to \"LIKE\" our page!"
