<p>The night before what should be my last final of my college career (though I leave the possibility open of going back for another degree in the future).</p>  <p>I’ve got a final for my Money, Banking and Financial Markets class at 2pm tomorrow. Assuming I pass it should be the last final I have to take.</p>  <p>15 years, 5 months and many days after I started. I likely won’t be “official” until May, but at least I should be done! *knock on wood*</p>
