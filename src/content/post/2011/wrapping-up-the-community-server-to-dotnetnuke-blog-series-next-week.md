<p>I had hoped to finish up my Community Server to <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> blog series tonight, but I realized there is just too much less to cover!</p>  <p>I’m working tonight to get the HTTPModule that I created to handle the URL mapping from CommunityServer to DotNetNuke URLs into codeplex. I haven’t touched the code in a few months, and for simplicity sake I had just created using my standard <a href="https://christoctemplate.codeplex.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke Module Template</a>, which contains way more information than is necessary for a simple HTTPModule. I’m ripping out the module code and working on cleaning up the project/manifest so it will install properly as just an HTTPModule.</p>  <p>In combination of this module, and the URLMaster Friendly URL Provider from <a href="https://www.ifinity.com.au">www.ifinity.com.au</a> I have both of my sites that were converted from Community server, redirecting to DotNetNuke URLs. I would highly recommend checking out URL Master as a solution for all your DotNetNuke websites, not just conversion sites. I’ll have a separate blog post with more details on what I configured in URLMaster to make this all work.</p>  <p>We’re moving over the next 4-5 days, so it is unlikely that I will get the entire blog series finished up, but hopefully I can do so in the next week or so. </p>  <p>In the mean time check out the older posts.</p>  <p>Previous Posts:   <br /><a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33060/Converting-From-CommunityServer-to-DotNetNuke-Intr.aspx">Part 1: An Introduction</a>    <br /><a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33098/CommunityServer-to-DotNetNuke-Part-2-DotNetNuke-I.aspx">Part 2: DotNetNuke Installation</a>    <br /><a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33102/Part-3-Converting-users-from-CommunityServer-to-D.aspx">Part 3: Converting users from CommunityServer to DotNetNuke</a>    <br /><a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33114/Part-4-Getting-the-conversion-tables-ready-for-CS.aspx">Part 4: Getting the conversion tables ready for CS&#160; to DNN</a>    <br /><a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33123/Part-5-Moving-Forum-threads-from-CommunityServer.aspx">Part 5: Moving Forum threads from CommunityServer to DotNetNuke</a>    <br /><a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tips/itemId/33327/Part-6-Community-Server-to-DotNetNuke-Moving-Foru.aspx" target="_blank">Part 6: Community Server to DotNetNuke Moving Forum Replies and Attachments</a>.</p>
