excerpt: "On Monday August 21, 1995, I started college at what was then known as the University of Missouri – Rolla (UMR), now referred to as Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST). If I recall correctly I started at 7:30am with an Algebra/Trig class designed to speed freshmen into the math program if you didn’t test out of the class. Even though I had taken Calculus in High School I wasn’t successful at testing out.  Today, May 14, 2011, I am done with college, not done in as I am not going anymore (I leave that option open) but done in as I have a college degree. Before I talk about that here are some stats.  "

<p>On Monday August 21, 1995, I started college at what was then known as the University of Missouri – Rolla (UMR), now referred to as Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST). If I recall correctly I started at 7:30am with an Algebra/Trig class designed to speed freshmen into the math program if you didn’t test out of the class. Even though I had taken Calculus in High School I wasn’t successful at testing out.</p>  <p>Today, May 14, 2011, I am done with college, not done in as I am not going anymore (I leave that option open) but done in as I have a college degree. Before I talk about that here are some stats.</p>  <p>It has been <strong>5746 days</strong> since I started school at UMR.</p>  <p>That is <strong>15 years, 8 months, 24 days</strong>, or <strong>496,454,400 seconds</strong>, <strong>8,274,240 minutes</strong>, <strong>137,904 hours</strong> or finally <strong>820 weeks</strong> (rounded down) which doesn’t sound that bad, right?</p>  <p>I stayed at Rolla for 4.5 years, give or take, not completing a degree in Computer Science. After that I worked a number of jobs and took a variety of classes. I won’t bore you with all the details of what happened in between, but you can check out my “<a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/blog/itemid/1375/how-did-i-get-to-where-i-am-in-my-career" target="_blank">How did I get to where I am in my career</a>” post from a few years ago.</p>    <p>I continued to take classes over the years, trying to get finished up. Fast forward to today. I have officially finished my college degree, a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Economics</strong> with a minor in Computer Science from the University of Missouri – St. Louis (UMSL).</p>    <p>What am I going to do with a Bachelor of Science in Economics? Who knows, I don’t have any plans to change where I am or what I am doing. In the future though I’ll leave open the idea of an MBA, but not right away <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile" alt="Open-mouthed smile" src="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//Windows-Live-Writer/429789888b75_8C5A/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile_2.png" /></p>    <p>I had a hell of a time trying to figure out when school started in August of 1995. UMR.edu is no more, and MST.edu doesn’t have a good collection of “archives”. I did however manage to find minutes from <a href="https://scholarsmine.mst.edu/minutes/pdf/fs_9394_09007dcc80780fc8.pdf" target="_blank">UMR Academic Council meetings from 1993-1994</a> when they approved the calendar for 1995, which showed the date of 8/21/1995. I will confirm that by digging through my file cabinet, I’m pretty sure I have a file from UMR somewhere that will likely have the information as well.</p>
