excerpt: "That’s my goal for this week, to ride 50 miles. In all honesty, it isn’t that much, but I can with about 99% confidence say that I have never ridden a bike 50 miles in one week. Yesterday afternoon I went for a ride up Highway 1 to Moss Beach, and then over towards the ocean. My first time really climbing on a bike. It wasn’t much of a climb, but according to my Garmin I did gain 1,118ft in elevation, far more than any other ride as of late."

<p>That’s my goal for this week, to ride 50 miles. In all honesty, it isn’t that much, but I can with about 99% confidence say that I have never ridden a bike 50 miles in one week. Yesterday afternoon I went for a ride up Highway 1 to Moss Beach, and then over towards the ocean. My first time really climbing on a bike. It wasn’t much of a climb, but according to my Garmin I did gain 1,118ft in elevation, far more than any other ride as of late.</p>  <p>I rode about 14 miles yesterday, and managed to get up on the other side of Pillar Point, I took a few photos, which I think turned out rather cool considering they were on my phone or point and shoot. <a title="Moss Beach" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5850492116/"><img border="0" alt="Moss Beach" src="https://static.flickr.com/3073/5850492116_fd54cb33e6_m.jpg" /></a>&#160;<a title="Moss Beach" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5849937545/"><img border="0" alt="Moss Beach" src="https://static.flickr.com/5303/5849937545_7160504c59_m.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>I then did some downhill mountain biking, or at least what I will call it, which was a totally new experience! Fun though. I managed 14.67 miles yesterday.</p>  <p>Today after work I went for a ride, again to Pillar Point, but this time my normal route, coming up from the south side (yesterday I came in from the north). The pictures weren’t as cool, but I didn’t plan to ride for 1:30 like I did yesterday. To and from Pillar Point is ~10 miles from our house, though I did side track a bit after reaching my destination, heading down a dirt path out under the point to the beach. I did 10.73 miles total.</p>  <p><a title="Today&#39;s bike ride view" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5855605840/"><img border="0" alt="Today&#39;s bike ride view" src="https://static.flickr.com/5150/5855605840_065e87b40e_m.jpg" /></a>&#160;<a title="Today&#39;s bike ride view" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5855606414/"><img border="0" alt="Today&#39;s bike ride view" src="https://static.flickr.com/5109/5855606414_fa09bda808_m.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>So, 2 days down for the week, and I’m at 25.40 miles. As long as I get 2 more rides in I shouldn’t have any problem hitting my goal before Sunday. Hopefully!</p>
