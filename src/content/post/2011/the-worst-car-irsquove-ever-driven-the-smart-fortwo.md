<p>So I am in Canada today/tomorrow at <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a>’s engineering office. I got into Vancouver early this morning and picked up my rental car. When I was walking by the rental cars I saw a ton of Fiat 500s, I was hoping that Hertz would have those for rent, as that was where my reservation was.</p>  <p><a title="My smart car (rental)" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5928694107/"><img border="0" alt="My smart car rental" align="right" src="https://static.flickr.com/6030/5928694107_fdc19f7416_m.jpg" /></a>To my dismay they did not, they offered me a Smart ForTwo. I figured, what the hell, I’ll try it out. Big mistake.</p>  <p>This has to be the biggest POS I’ve ever driven. The car can’t shift to save its life, it is an automatic transmission that feels like a 15 year old trying to learn to drive a manual is controlling the clutch.</p>  <p>The brakes won’t hold the car in place unless you hold the pedal to the floor.</p>  <p>It has no power (can’t say I expected any), it is loud, I have to wonder if the damn thing is a diesel, I guess I need to figure that out before I return it tomorrow evening.</p>  <p>Comfort wise it actually doesn’t feel too small, the drive is okay once you get past the brakes, sound, and transmission.</p>  <p>If you ever get the chance to drive/buy a Smart ForTwo, don’t!</p>
