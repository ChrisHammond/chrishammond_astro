excerpt: "We got our lease on the place in Half Moon Bay today!   I tried to get a moving quote from Stevens Van Lines, the company that moved us here from Colorado, but I haven’t heard back from them. I guess I will have to try a few more companies.  Anyone know any good movers on the peninsula in the Bay Area?"
