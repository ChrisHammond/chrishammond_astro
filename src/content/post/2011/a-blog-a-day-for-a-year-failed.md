excerpt: "Well, here we are, Day 149 of 365, and what is missing? Day 148.  I failed, I made it all the way until May 27th blogging every day of 2011, and on May 28th, I didn’t blog. This post will go up 7 minutes after midnight, on the 29th, meaning I missed the 28th.  Oh well, I will continue to try to blog the rest of the year, hopefully 5/28 is the only day I miss.  I blame Comcast. I was going to blog earlier but I got on with tech support trying to resolve our phone troubles, and completely zoned out."
