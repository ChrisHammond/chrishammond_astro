<p>Well <a href="https://richarddumas.net" target="_blank">Richard Dumas</a> and I made it to Evanston, IL for the <a href="https://www.cmsx.us" target="_blank">CMS Expo</a> that begins on Monday. We’re setting up the booth and such tomorrow. </p>  <p>It was a pretty uneventful trip, I didn’t realize American Airlines had moved at SFO to the new terminal, it’s pretty nice, much nicer than the other terminals.</p>  <p>Now we need to find some dinner, and find a place to watch UFC 129!</p>
