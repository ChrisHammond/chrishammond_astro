excerpt: "Well Richard Dumas and I made it to Evanston, IL for the CMS Expo that begins on Monday. We’re setting up the booth and such tomorrow.   It was a pretty uneventful trip, I didn’t realize American Airlines had moved at SFO to the new terminal, it’s pretty nice, much nicer than the other terminals.  Now we need to find some dinner, and find a place to watch UFC 129!"
