excerpt: "So this year will be my 3rd year, (would be my 4th if I hadn’t bailed at the last minute on year 1), that I will be speaking at the St. Louis Day(s) of .Net. If you haven’t been to the STLDODN you should definitely check it out. It is a great two day event, and at $125 (if you register by 7/8/2011) the price can hardly be beat!  The event is being held this year on August 5th and 6th, 2011. Again at the Ameristar Casino in St. Charles, MO, about 10 minutes from where I used to live (two moves ago now).  Read the full blog post for all the details.  Tags: DotNetNuke,NetDuino,DNN,Training,St. Louis,World,DNNWorldCategory: CommunityCategory: EventsCategory: DevelopmentCategory: DotNetNuke Corporation"
