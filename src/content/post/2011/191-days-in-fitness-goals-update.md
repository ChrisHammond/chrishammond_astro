<p>So, here we are, July 10th, 2011, day 191 of the year. So where are we at in terms of the fitness goals? <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/blog/itemid/2048/2010-year-in-review-and-whatrsquos-coming-in-201" target="_blank">On January 1st I posted that I wanted to ride a bike for at least 500 miles this year, and I wanted to skate at least 100 miles</a>.</p>  <p>To be honest, things got off to a slow start, especially for biking as I didn’t ride a bike until May. In January I got a couple of skates in, though not as many as I would have liked. I then didn’t skate until today, far too long.</p>  <h2>Skating Total</h2>  <p>24.90 miles</p>  <h2>Biking Total</h2>  <p>135.91 miles</p>  <p>So I started actually riding a bike in late May, when I purchased my <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-5357262-10456937?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fstyle%2FCJ%2F810329%3Fpartner%3Daff_cj%26mr%3AtrackingCode%3D90EADB59-C1D7-DF11-B41F-0019B9C043EB%26mr%3AreferralID%3DNA&amp;cjsku=810329" target="_blank">Cannondale Quick CX 1</a>. With that in mind, I think I am well on my way to actually getting to 500 miles. I would hope I could have that 500 miles done by <a href="https://www.jacquelinehammond.com" target="_blank">Jacqueline</a>’s first birthday on 10/9, but we’ll see, I have a lot of things coming up between now and then!</p>  <p>I’m also going to try to start skating more, maybe I’ll shoot for skating once a week and biking 3 times a week? I think that’s a pretty lofty goal, but will definitely ensure that I hit the other goals.</p>
