<p>So here we are, getting ready to move again, so what do I need to do? Well, remove all the Insteon hardware from the house of course! This post is actually a year and a half too late, as we have actually moved once already, we left our house in Colorado to move to California. Making that house “dumb” was easy, as I had only put in two Insteon switches in that house. </p>  <p>Here in California I had wired up 7 various <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;offerid=224615.10000039&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" target="new">INSTEON SwitchLinc</a><img border="0" src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;bids=224615.10000039&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" width="1" height="1" /> devices throughout the house, with a combination of relays and sending units. I never really took it 100% like I wanted to, but I also knew we wouldn’t be living here for more than a year. So I removed all of the switches this weekend. Installing the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=5s9KOchWgxI&amp;offerid=224615.10000039&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" target="_blank">SwitchLinc</a> devices is easy, removing them is just as easy. Though I did run into one stumbling block. The hall lighting in this house was wired with a 4 way switch. I had no clue what that meant, except that it had 3 switches that could control the lights.</p>  <p>When I had wired up the Insteon switches I ended up making only one of the switches work, the other two were plated off. Well that wouldn’t be acceptable for the land lord so I had to figure out how to get it working. Fortunately I came across this website that showed me <a href="https://www.wfu.edu/~matthews/misc/switches/confused4way.html" target="_blank">how to figure out the wiring of a 4-way switch</a>.</p>  <p>Hopefully with the new place I’ll have the opportunity to wire things up again and this time I can go all out. I’ve got plenty of devices to use.</p>
