excerpt: "No, not at 95mph, but at 95 years old? That’s what I want, to be driving when I’m 95.  Our new neighbor apparently is, though I haven’t confirmed his age, 95, and still driving! I’ll have to ask his son just how old his father is.  I want to be that guy when I’m 95, still with it and driving."
