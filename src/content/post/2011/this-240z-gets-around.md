excerpt: "Apparently that’s the word on the 240z. I sold it in January 2010 (or somewhere close to there) and since then it has apparently changed owners twice (possibly more).  I emailed the guy who sent me photos in October after he painted it, to see how it was, and he tells me it was sold in December   If you are the new owner, drop me a line, I’m curious how things are going."
