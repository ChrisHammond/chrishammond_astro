<p>Nothing seems to be working tonight!</p>  <p>I spent some time in the garage tonight, and didn’t manage to get a single one of the bushings out of the control arm. I’m hoping to spend some more time tomorrow after work.</p>  <p>Then I came in to work on some things for the office tomorrow. All I will say about that is, I can’t stand SQL Express! It is such a pain to try to get it to work when it just doesn’t want to.</p>
