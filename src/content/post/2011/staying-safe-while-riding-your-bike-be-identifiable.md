excerpt: "So as a new bike rider I am highly concerned about being safe while I ride. I also don't like the idea of carrying my wallet with me while I ride. It's bulky, could get lost, or who knows what else. Last year while watching the Tour de France I saw advertisements for RoadID and I though, what the heck is that for? Well, this year as I started riding I quickly figured it out. What would happen if I got into an accident while I was out riding, sans wallet. What if I was unable to speak, how would anyone know who I was, where I lived, or how to get in touch with my wife and baby?"
