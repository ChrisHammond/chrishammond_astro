excerpt: "So today was our first time taking Jacqueline out for a bike ride. She loved it! If by loving it, I mean, she pretty much slept through the whole thing. A little back story, Jacqueline is coming up on 10 months old here in the next week and a half. She had a doctors appointment last week and the doc said it was okay to start pulling her behind the bike in a trailer if she's strong enough to sit herself up. So we took the opportunity today to do just that. We loaded up the bikes and trailer, and headed over to Bicycle Sundays on Ca&ntilde;ada Road in San Mateo County. Basically on most Sundays they shut down a 2.5 mile stretch of the road south of highway 92, for biking. It is a nice smooth surface, and a safe place to ride, there are tons of folks out there."
