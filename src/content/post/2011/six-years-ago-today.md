<p>Six years ago today I met the most beautiful woman in the world. We met for dinner at Applebees, we closed the place down. We had talked on Match.com for a few days prior to meeting, but January 29th, 2005 was the first time we saw each other face to face.</p>  <p>Less than nine months later we were engaged, and less than two years later we were married. Weâ€™ve been married 4 years now, and have a beautiful baby girl (almost 4 months).</p>  <p>I love you Natalie.</p>
