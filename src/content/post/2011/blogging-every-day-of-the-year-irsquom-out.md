excerpt: "So there goes Day 3, I missed another blog post.  To be honest, I wasn’t too up for blogging yesterday. Too much going on with the conference, I didn’t feel like writing anything. So I guess it is official! I’m done with the blogging every day for the year. I’ll blog as I have content, rather than trying to blog just because."
