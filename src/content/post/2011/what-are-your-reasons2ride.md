So I am stealing the title for this posting, but I swear I have a good reason for doing so! When I finally got around to setting up this BicycleTips website I stumbled across another guy who started blogging this year about biking. Joel over at at&nbsp;www.reasons2ride.com&nbsp;has a great website coming along. Be sure to head on over and follow his progress. In short, Joel got fed up with his life, his weight, and decided to change things. Something I completely understand. I have a very similar goals, to get in better shape, and to lose weight. Bicycling is my method to achieve those goals, just as Joel's. <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/12">Read More at www.bicycletips.com</a>
