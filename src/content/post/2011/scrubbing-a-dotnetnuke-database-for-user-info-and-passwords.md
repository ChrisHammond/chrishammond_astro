excerpt: "If you’ve ever needed to send a backup of your DotNetNuke database to a developer for testing, you likely trust the developer enough to do so without scrubbing your data, but just to be safe it is probably best that you do take the time to scrub.  Before you do anything with the SQL below, make sure you have a backup of your website! I would recommend you do the following.     Backup your existing production database     Restore a backup of your production database as a NEW database     Run the scripts below on the NEW database     Shrink the NEW database     Backup the NEW database    Tags: DotNetNuke;Database;Administration;Admin;SQL;DB;Shrink;BackupCategory: ReferenceCategory: User ExperienceCategory: DevelopmentCategory: Security"
