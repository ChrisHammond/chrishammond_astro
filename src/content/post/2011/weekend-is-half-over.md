excerpt: "What happened to the weekend? It’s already Saturday evening! I guess playing Xbox until 3am and sleeping till 9am, then another 2 hours in the afternoon, kind of kills your day!  I did manage to get blinds up in Jacqueline’s playroom, which will be my mother’s room this coming weekend while she’s here for a visit.  Tomorrow I’m hoping to get a bike ride in, the cars washed/waxed and then have a nice BBQ when the Strohl’s come over."
