<p>Well it just goes to show you. Having the right tool for a job is the key to getting the job done right.</p>  <p>Last night I spent some time trying to get the bushings out again, I didn't have any luck. I then ran to Home Depot and picked up a 6&rdquo; vise.</p>  <p>Tonight I mounted the vise to my work bench and got to work. It didn't take long, with the vise in place I was able to knock out the first bushing. The 2nd and 3rd took a little work, but were much easier than the first one.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.autocrossblog.com/success-the-bushings-are-removed-from-the-upper-control-arms">Read the full post over on AutocrossBlog.com</a></p>
