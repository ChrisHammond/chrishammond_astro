excerpt: "So I was doing some reading tonight on my Nerdkit, I had planned to actually do some playing around with it, but decided just to read a bit. I’ve never coded in C, I did C++ in College (not very well) and do most of my development in C# these days (when I’m doing code, mostly for fun). While all similar, there are a few differences, so doing things in C is a learning experience. "

<p>So I was doing some reading tonight <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/blog/itemid/2056/writing-code-for-a-temperature-sensorhellip" target="_blank">on my Nerdkit</a>, I had planned to actually do some playing around with it, but decided just to read a bit. I’ve never coded in C, I did C++ in College (not very well) and do most of my development in C# these days (when I’m doing code, mostly for fun). While all similar, there are a few differences, so doing things in C is a learning experience. </p>  <p>There was some practice questions for AND and OR using Binary. Here are some examples.</p>  <p>When comparing binary with AND&#160; you and up getting a 1 if both bits are 1, and 0 if they are not. </p>  <p>Example: 11111111 &amp; 00001100 = 00001100 </p>  <p>while OR would produce a 1 if either bit is 1. </p>  <p>Example: 111111111 | 00001100 = 11111111</p>  <p>But then I came across something I didn’t understand</p>  <p>11011010 &amp; ~(1&lt;&lt;3)</p>  <p>~ is pretty easy, it means NOT, but what is (1&lt;&lt;3) ? I had no clue, so I did some Googling for (1&lt;&lt;3), (1&lt;&lt;2) and the like, w/ quotes, without quotes, etc. That produced absolutely nothing useful unless I was trying to get a third cup of sugar…. So I figured, well if Google can’t figure out what I want I would try to use Bing, that produced results just as useless.</p>  <p>So, what next? Well, I decided to try <a href="https://www.WolframAlpha.com">www.WolframAlpha.com</a>&#160;</p>  <p>What do you know? It actually told me what it was, sort of. </p>  <p><a href="https://www2.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(1%3C%3C3)">https://www2.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(1%3C%3C3)</a></p>  <p>It told me that it was performing a BitShift, which at least got me somewhere. A quick search for “C BitShift” and I found a page that explains it well enough. <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc311/Notes/BitOp/bitshift.html">https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc311/Notes/BitOp/bitshift.html</a></p>  <p>So what is the result?</p>  <p>11011010 &amp; ~(1&lt;&lt;3)</p>  <p>Well 1 is really 00000001, shifted to the left 3 bits would be 00001000, (which is actually 8 as n integer)</p>  <p>11011010 &amp; ~(00001000) so the &amp; for that would be 11010010</p>  <p>There was another example in the Nerdkit documentation as well, for OR</p>  <p>11011010 | (1&lt;&lt;2)</p>  <p>11011010 | (00000100) = 11011010</p>  <p>So there you go. I learned something new for today. Hopefully this weekend I’ll actually get the Nerdkit doing something else besides the temperature sensor I have it configured for. Perhaps I’ll get it going and connected to <a href="https://www.Project350z.com" target="_blank">Project350z.com</a> (hey, it is a three day weekend).    </p>
