excerpt: "Holy Cow! If you live in the San Francisco Bay Area and donâ€™t have plans tomorrow, or if you do have plans, cancel them. You need to get the Maker Faire at the San Mateo County Event Center. Check out www.makerfaire.com for more info!  I went this morning, and I am going to go again tomorrow, this time taking the family with me. This morning I headed over with my GoPro camera attached to my head, with the intention of time lapsing the day. I stuck it to the top of a trusty Boston Red Sox hat, which I hoped would last.  "

<p>Holy Cow! If you live in the San Francisco Bay Area and don't have plans tomorrow, or if you do have plans, cancel them. You need to get the Maker Faire at the San Mateo County Event Center. Check out <a href="https://www.makerfaire.com">www.makerfaire.com</a> for more info!</p> <p>I went this morning, and I am going to go again tomorrow, this time taking the family with me. This morning I headed over with my GoPro camera attached to my head, with the intention of time lapsing the day. I stuck it to the top of a trusty Boston Red Sox hat, which I hoped would last.</p> <p><a title="I'll be the guy wearing this at Maker Faire" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5743553626/"><img alt="I'll be the guy wearing this at Maker Faire" src="https://static.flickr.com/5063/5743553626_f88da31d0a_m.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a></p> <p>I got there a bit before it opened, walked around to see where the entrance was and then started taking pictures of the bubble guy out front entertaining the kids. </p> <p><a title="Crazy bubbles at Maker Faire" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5743040527/"><img alt="Crazy bubbles at Maker Faire" src="https://static.flickr.com/2705/5743040527_a74598b3d1_m.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a></p> <p>When I entered the Maker Faire I immediately found myself at the NorCal Mars Rover table, that made me want to build some RC cars <img style="border-style: none;" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile" alt="Open-mouthed smile" src="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//windows-live-writer/my-first-time-at-maker-faire_13d96/wlemoticon-openmouthedsmile_2.png" /> I went from there to the TechShop building and checked out all the cool equipment they had in there. I made it from there over to the Google trailers, seeing more cool RC like cars, using the recently talked about Android ADK setups.</p> <p><a title="Maker Faire 2011" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5745010407/"><img alt="Maker Faire 2011" src="https://static.flickr.com/2589/5745010407_f272f16a65_m.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a><a title="Maker Faire 2011" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5745010033/"><img alt="Maker Faire 2011" src="https://static.flickr.com/2251/5745010033_bf9b1251da_m.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a><a title="Maker Faire 2011" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5745009025/"><img alt="Maker Faire 2011" src="https://static.flickr.com/2195/5745009025_74414a61a0_m.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a><a title="Maker Faire 2011" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5745008169/"><img alt="Maker Faire 2011" src="https://static.flickr.com/5221/5745008169_4efba42423_m.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a></p> <p>I then made my way into the Maker Shed, which I knew was going to cost me some money, but it was time well spent, and money too. I picked up a number of Netduino related products so I can start playing around with some microcontroller projects here soon.</p> <p>Just as I was about to leave the MakerShed my GoPro fell off my hat, fortunately I had the lanyard setup so that it fell around my neck. I stuck it back on the hat, and then made my way outside. I ended up having to switch the camera to be around my neck, which made for less than desirable angles, but it is what it is.</p> <p>The camera on the hat started all sorts of fun conversations, and even generated a few business cards for folks who wanted me to send them a link to the video when it is posted. </p> <p>I definitely wore myself out today, I know there is a ton more stuff still to see tomorrow, which is why we are heading back. I am thinking we will likely go early on in the morning like I did today, otherwise parking and crowds will be a huge pain.</p> <p>Here are the two videos from the day, the first being one I shot, and edited, on my Motorola Xoom.</p> <p><iframe height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/08HqbG4Yd2U?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p>The second being the time lapse from the day (depending on when you are reading this, the video may still be uploading).</p> <p><iframe width="425" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jxa8aYJuaNI?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/photos/view/setdisplay/setid/72157626651335407.aspx" target="_blank">Here is a link to my Flickr photo set</a>. </p> <p>Tomorrow I'm going to take the good camera (and the GoPro) </p>
