excerpt: "So today I went back at the suspension of the car.   Time lapse of lowering the suspension, in reverse   The problem with the video is that I did the time lapse in reverse! I mistakenly sorted the photos in descending order instead of ascending. You really can’t tell on the time lapse though, it just looks like another time lapse!  See the full post for more photos"
