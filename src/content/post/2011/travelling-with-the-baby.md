<p>Today was our longest day away from the house with the baby, and all in all things went very well.</p> <p>We left around 10am and headed up towards Vacaville, timing it so that the baby had a bottle around 8:30, and was up until we hit the road at 10. She fell asleep and woke about 20 minutes into our lunch at Panera Bread at Nut Tree in Vacaville. From there she had a bottle and was awake for more of the next couple of hours as we did a little shopping at the outlet mall in Vacaville.</p> <p>Then we headed off to a Super Bowl party in Fairfield, Jacqueline got another bottle there, but didn't get down to sleep till probably almost 5pm, it was loud, and she wasn't too big a fan of the cheering (mostly from silly Steelers fans) but she held up very well.</p> <p>She got another bottle right before we left and slept the whole ride home. Natalie fed her again when we got home, though I think she slept through most of that feeding. We'll see how she sleeps tonight, hopefully most of the night! I'm off to bed early as well, I am going to hit the office early so I can spend a few hours in the&nbsp; afternoon dealing with the Nissan Leaf which is at the dealer waiting.</p>
