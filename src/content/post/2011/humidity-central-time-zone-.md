excerpt: "Disadvantages of being in New Orleans, HUMIDITY, I still hate you.  Advantages of being in New Orleans, Central Time Zone, all the shows come on early!  Flying into New Orleans has to be one of the best views ever. It is amazing.  This evening I walked around a bit looking for dinner, a nice trip around the French Quarter. I didn’t take my good camera, just the point and shoot, but I took a couple of photos, here are two I uploaded.  &#160;"
