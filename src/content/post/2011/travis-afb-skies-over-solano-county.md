<p>If you’re going to the Travis AFB Skies over Solano County this weekend, good luck finding a schedule! Actually, good luck of finding much of anything.</p>  <p>The website for the show appears to be <a href="https://www.travisairexpo.com/">https://www.travisairexpo.com/</a> but it hardly has anything useful on there. The only thing that is of any use is the do’s and don’ts section of the FAQ.</p>  <p>I’m hoping to get out there on Saturday to see the Thunderbirds, but there is no telling when they will actually perform. I assume later in the afternoon, hopefully that assumption isn’t wrong!</p>  <p>Maybe next year the folks running the show will setup a <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> based website, hell I’ll even help them out, so they can see how easy it is to setup and maintain content with <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">the best open source content management system</a>.</p>  <p>UPDATE: Finally I found some info, looks like they will close the show around 3pm! <a href="https://www.dailydemocrat.com/ci_18574402?source=most_viewed">https://www.dailydemocrat.com/ci_18574402?source=most_viewed</a></p>
