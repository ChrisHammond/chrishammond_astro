<p>So the biggest question we’ve had from other people since we decided that we are moving to Colorado has been what will you do for work?</p>  <p>Well my answer is an easy one. I will continue to work for <a href="https://www.engagesoftware.com" target="_blank">Engage Software</a>, I just simply be working out of a home office for a while, with the intention of expanding the business with a new office out west as we grow even more. That will require growing our business in the region and then looking for talented people to fit whatever needs arise. </p>  <p>Natalie on the other hand is sort of in an unknown position. Currently she has her own business out here doing Dressage training. She loves what she does, but it takes a LOT of time and energy to do what she does. She is looking forward to not having to work as much after we move. She’s not quite sure what she wants to do, but I imagine it will still involve Dressage Training out in Ft. Collins, just not on the same scale as she is doing here in St. Louis.</p>  <p>So, that answers one of the biggest questions we’ve had when people find out we’re moving. </p>
