excerpt: "A few semesters ago here at UMSL (www.umsl.edu) I took a geospatial analysis class, analyzing data from sources such as the census, to provide analysis of various things within a community.  This evening while looking at the Ft. Collins city website I ran across a survey of its citizens from 2008. After looking over that I figured I would geek out a little bit and look for crime statistics for the Ft. Collins area and come up with an analysis of what parts of town are best to live in from a number of perspectives.  This is not information that a real estate agent is likely to provide you, I could be wrong, but I think real estate agents are limited in some of the questions they can answer as to not show bias and discrimination on certain parts of town/people. This data and analysis isn’t something I’m going to have together here in the next week or two, but I will try to get it together before we make our next trip out to Colorado, we are planning on late March.  Of course I will blog all of this gathered information as I find and analyze the information."
