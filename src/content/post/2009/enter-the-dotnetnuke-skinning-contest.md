<p>The last <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Programs/SkinningContest/tabid/1268/Default.aspx" target="_blank">DotNetNuke Skinning contest</a> was held in <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/contest/Home/tabid/655/Default.aspx">2004</a>, and I must say I am still bitter than my entry, <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/contest/Professional/Gear%20Factory/tabid/678/Default.aspx">Gear Factory</a> didn’t win. (Just kidding, I am wacky enough to actually post a link to that skin and claim it, I think it is funny how bad it is!)</p>  <p>Enough about that contest from 5 years ago, finally, in 2009 there is a new <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Programs/SkinningContest/tabid/1268/Default.aspx" target="_blank">DotNetNuke skinning contest</a>, and this time around there are some kick ass prizes (XBOXs, a Netbook, and Expression Studio 3)! Submissions will be accepted starting on 12/21/2009, and can be submitted through 1/22/2010, giving you a month to get a skin submitted into the contest.</p>  <p>A few differences from the last skinning contest, this contest is setup to highlight <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> 5 specific skins, so be sure to follow the new manifest approach to skinning. There are also <a href="https://skins.dotnetnuke.com/Categories/tabid/64/Default.aspx">categories</a> like last time, but this time there are 4 of them</p>  <ol>   <li>Modern Business</li>    <li>Personal</li>    <li>Modern Web Standards</li>    <li>Think Outside the Box</li> </ol>  <p>Be sure to check out the <a href="https://skins.dotnetnuke.com/Requirements/tabid/56/Default.aspx">requirements</a> as licensing is another major difference from last time. Unfortunately last time around the license requirements weren’t set in the contest, and the winning skin was actually released under a license that said it couldn’t be modified in any way. That kind of defeats the purpose of a whole open source contest, so this time around skins must be licensed in the same manner than <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke Community Edition</a> is, using the MIT license. </p>  <p>One of the goals of this contest is to build up a repository of free skins that can showcase what DotNetNuke can do. If you are interested in contributing back to the project, and at the same time getting the chance to win an XBOX 360, Netbook, or cool software be sure to enter the contest, check out the link below for more information! </p>  <p><a title="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Programs/SkinningContest/tabid/1268/Default.aspx" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Programs/SkinningContest/tabid/1268/Default.aspx">https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Programs/SkinningContest/tabid/1268/Default.aspx</a></p>  <p><a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Programs/SkinningContest/tabid/1268/Default.aspx"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="skin-contest-468[1]" border="0" alt="Skinning Contest " src="https://skins.dotnetnuke.com/Portals/0/site-images/skin-contest-468.jpg" width="472" height="64" /></a></p>
