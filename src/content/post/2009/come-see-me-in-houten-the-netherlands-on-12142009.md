<p>So this may or may not be considered a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a> tip, I guess it depends on your view of me as a speaker. On Monday 12/14 I will be in Houten, The Netherlands presenting at the <a href="https://www.sdn.nl/SDN/SDNEvent/SDNEventdecember2009/tabid/132/Default.aspx">SDN event</a>.</p> <p>I will be delivering <a href="https://www.sdn.nl/SDN/SDNEvent/SDNEventdecember2009/tabid/132/Default.aspx">three presentations</a>.</p> <ol>     <li>DotNetNuke, Advanced Template and Installation Configurations.</li>     <li>Creating a DotNetNuke Module for Facebook’s OpenStream API.</li>     <li>Handing off a DotNetNuke site, training your customers.</li> </ol> <p>Don’t worry if you don’t speak Dutch, the sessions will be in English! I look forward to getting to see some of my European DotNetNuke brethren again, I had a blast last time I was there (for OpenForce 08 in October 2008).</p> <p>Feel free to come up and ask me any questions you might have about DotNetNuke while I am there, I love trying to help out in any way I can. Also, if you have a <a href="https://bit.ly/dnnbook/">copy of my book</a> be sure to bring it and I will sign it!</p> <p>I’m going to be hanging out in Amsterdam on Saturday and Sunday, playing with my new camera and hopefully finding some good sights to shoot. If you’re in town shoot me an email, or <a href="https://twitter.com/christoc/">follow me on twitter</a>, perhaps we can meet up. I don’t think I’ll have a phone on me that works, but I may bring along an old phone and see if I can’t find a pay as you go sim card to use while I am there. I’ll try to have my Droid hop on Wifi now and then so I can update my status as I wander around the town.</p>
