<p>So just an FYI so others don’t waste money like I did. The steering column off a 1978 280Z will NOT fit on a 1973 240Z. I contacted the ebay seller to check before hand and was assured it would, unfortunately upon reciept and attempt at putting it in the car it does not fit :(</p>  <p>I guess I’ll just have to rig the bad 73 column for the haul to Colorado and look for another solution in the coming months. </p>  <p>Lesson learned, don’t trust ebay sellers to know what they are talking about.</p>
