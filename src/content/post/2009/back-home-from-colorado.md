excerpt: "So we’re back home from Colorado and have the Envoy unpacked. It was a great trip, Natalie and I had fun, though we were a little tired of sitting in the car with nearly thirty-eight and a half hours of driving, and definitely another hour or so more of just sitting in it throughout the weekend.    I’ll do a summary post later this week, but the trip went very well, we got a lot of information and have a good idea on what we will be doing later this year! Here’s what the roads looked like yesterday afternoon driving up to Littleton, Colorado from Castle Rock.  "
