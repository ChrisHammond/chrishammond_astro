<p>Want to know a great way to get involved with DotNetNuke? Attend a user <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/UserGroups/tabid/1074/Default.aspx">group meeting</a>! One of the best things about DotNetNuke is the community of users who work with the product. You can likely find a local user group using the tools available on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/UserGroups/tabid/1074/Default.aspx">DotNetNuke.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>What is a DotNetNuke User Group?</strong> User groups are pretty simple, they are a collection of people who get together to learn and discuss a topic, in our case the topic of choice is DotNetNuke. Most user groups will have a meeting once a month, though some have them less frequently.</p> <p><strong>Why?</strong> User group meetings are a great way to meet other people interesting in DotNetNuke, and often times at user group meetings you will find that you can get help from other people, face to face. You may even find yourself a new job! A lot of times at user groups people will be looking for people that can do DNN development, skinning, or even implementation. You’ll find interesting topics discussed at user group meetings, maybe even learning things about DNN that you didn’t know before. If you are interested you can probably give a presentation yourself, on a topic you are comfortable with of course, or even one that you want to learn. Prepping for a presentation is a great way to learn more about a topic.</p> <p>You can also get free stuff at user group meetings, often times free DotNetNuke books, t-shirts, and even free software!</p> <p><strong>How do I join?</strong> Joining a DNN user group is free, you can register for one by visiting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/UserGroups/tabid/1074/Default.aspx">DotNetNuke.com’s User Groups page</a>. Some user groups have their own websites that you can also register on to get notifications, here’s a sample listing of some of the groups, please feel free to add other links to the comments below.</p> <ul>     <li><a target="_blank" href="https://denver.dnnug.com/">Denver DotNetNuke</a></li>     <li><a target="_blank" href="https://stlouis.dnnug.com/">St. Louis DotNetNuke</a></li>     <li><a target="_blank" href="https://orlando.dotnetnukeug.net/">Orlando DotNetNuke</a></li>     <li><a target="_blank" href="https://cleveland.dnnug.com/">Cleveland DotNetNuke</a></li>     <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.capitaldug.org">Capital DotNetNuke</a></li>     <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dnnboston.org">Boston DotNetNuke</a></li>     <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagodnn.org/">Chicago DotNetNuke</a></li>     <li><a target="_blank" href="https://dnnct.org/">Connecticut DotNetNuke</a></li>     <li><a target="_blank" href="https://dnntampa.com">Tampa DotNetNuke</a></li>     <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.seadug.com">Seattle DotNetNuke</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>When are the meetings?</strong> Meeting locations, times, and topics will vary, so be sure to check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Events/tabid/644/Default.aspx">events calendar on DotNetNuke.com</a> for upcoming meetings.</p> <p><strong>Are you in Denver?</strong> If you are in the Denver area you should check out <a href="https://denver.dnnug.com/">https://denver.dnnug.com/</a> the local user group web site.
