<div class="watch-video-desc description"> <p><span>I&#160;spent the morning with Dave and Terec helping to finish buttoning up items on the 240Z so we could attempt to start it today. We were successful in getting to the point of attempting to start it, though we weren't successful in actually getting it started, there's an issue or two that I&#160;need to track down.&#160;Likely issues with timing and firing for the Megasquirt. Because the last time I had the car running was back in August 2007 I've now got a new laptop and don't have it configured for the Megasquirt. I'm hoping to get it setup tonight and try to hook it up tomorrow to see what I&#160;find.</span></p> <p><span>Here's the video from today's work.</span></p> </div> <p>[YouTube:Plj8ZyVgPuQ]</p>
