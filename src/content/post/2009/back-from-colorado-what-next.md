So Sunday Night Natalie and I were kind of freaking out. We didn’t like Fort Collins, and we didn’t know what to do. Actually, on Monday we were in the same boat, we looked at Longmont/Boulder, found a nice barn or two, but nothing on the housing front that would fit in our price range. Heck, Tuesday around noon we were still in the same boat, unsure of what we were going to do.
