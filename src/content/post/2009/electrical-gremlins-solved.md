<p>So the big scary electrical gremlins in the Audi were an easy fix. The ignition key gets stuck a little too far forward sometimes, so as long as everytime I start the car I turn the key back in the running position everything works fine! Yay for the easy fixes.</p>  <p>I thought the car was burning oil, when we got it it was 2qts low, then yesterday the oil light came on so I threw some in quickly. Today I got the oil changed (for free with a coupon, score) and they did a minor inspection of the car, found an oil leak. They want $220 to replace the oil pan gasket. Yeah right, I&#39;m not spending that! I&#39;ll do it myself sometime soon. Also need to get that windshield replaced soon too, but I think I might try to last through winter.</p>
