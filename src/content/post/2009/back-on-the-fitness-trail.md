<p>So Sunday Natalie and I headed up to Creve Coeur park. She walked the dogs and I skated for the first time this year. Boy did I hurt by the end of it, I think most of the pain was caused by a loose frame on my skate, which I didn’t notice until before I went to go skate today.</p>  <p>Sunday I went ~5miles in just over 30 minutes, with an average heart rate of 178, burning in excess of 1000 calories in that time period, at least according to the software.</p>  <p>Today I went ~4.8 miles in just over 28 minutes, a better pace than I did on Sunday, with an average HR of 179, though I did have a break during today’s session as I ran into an old friend on the trailer and stopped to talk for 5 minutes.</p>  <p>You can check out the results from Sunday and Today online at <a title="https://trail.motionbased.com/trail/user/chrishammond" href="https://trail.motionbased.com/trail/user/chrishammond">https://trail.motionbased.com/trail/user/chrishammond</a> it even has a map. </p>  <p>So I’m back in the fitness game, hoping to skate 4-5 times a week, I’ll try to get back out tomorrow, and might even try to get some in during the trip to Colorado this weekend, we’ll see how that goes.</p>  <p>I need to get on the Wii fit so I can track any weight changes, and do some other workouts, perhaps I’ll do that in the morning.</p>
