excerpt: "I was reminded by my Aunt tonight that 5 years ago this evening we were sitting in Busch Stadium watching the Boston Red Sox win their first World Series in 86 years! We were there for Game 4 of the 2004 World Series!  It was a great night to be a Red Sox Fan. I made a decent blog post about the game that you can read here, and I took HUNDREDS of photos of the game, available via my photo gallery.  Even though the baseball season is over for 2009, it's still good to relish in the Red Sox Championships from 2004 and 2007! Go Phillies, beat those damn Yankees. "
