<p>So one of the complaints I’ve had in this whole process of looking for a house is the lack of websites that actually show you good photos of a home. For some realtors don’t or can’t upload high quality photos of a house. Well we finally found a home that has high quality photos online, and I must say it is a great thing to see!</p>  <p>Here’s a link to the photos of the house I found. (click on start tour, then click on Full Screen).</p>  <p><a title="https://homesite.obeo.com/viewer/default.aspx?tourid=542611&refURL=&locale=en-US" href="https://homesite.obeo.com/viewer/default.aspx?tourid=542611&refURL=&locale=en-US">https://homesite.obeo.com/viewer/default.aspx?tourid=542611&refURL=&locale=en-US</a></p>  <p>Now, that tour doesn’t show you the garage, which is another one of my beefs, but it is definitely a step up from most of the listings we’ve seen.</p>  <p>Are you a realtor? Do you realize that people want to see large, high quality photos of a house? Are you not able to upload those to the listing websites?</p>
