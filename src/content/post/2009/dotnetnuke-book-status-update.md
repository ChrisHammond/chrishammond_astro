<p>So it’s <strike>Monday</strike> Tuesday morning and I just sent off my submission for the third chapter of our <a title="DotNetNuke" target="_blank" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a> book. Pat sent of his third chapter last week, he has one more to finish up, I have one and then we have one final chapter we are going to work on together as a closing/advanced topics section for the book. Our deadline is 2/20, I think we’ll be on target to get things finished up on time, if not on time a day or two late over that weekend. I’m looking forward to being “done” for a while, though I don’t imagine I will be slowing down anytime soon.</p> <p>After the book chapters are all submitted I imagine we’ll start getting the chapters back from the editors with changes. I also will be registering for an online economics course so that I can get the last few credits I need to finish up my BS in Econ in time for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.going2colorado.com/">our summer move</a>.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> it looks like the publish date for the book has been pushed back to 6/22/09 according to Amazon.</p>
