<p>So I should have been working on the book tonight, and I did get some done, but I took the evening to finally reskin <a href="https://www.project240z.com">www.project240z.com</a>. I took the skin that Dang designed for dotnetnukeblogs and reworked it for the Datsun.</p>  <p>What do you think?</p>  <p>A big thank you to Cuong Dang for all his design help over the years! I removed the link to his site because it doesn&#39;t appear to be active anymore.</p>  <p>If you are looking for a DotNetNuke Site Redesign be sure to let me know, I can help you out!</p>
