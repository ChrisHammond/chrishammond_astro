excerpt: "Natalie and I just booked another trip to Colorado using Priceline. We&#39;re going 4/3-4/5, Friday morning, and returning Sunday morning. Now to do lots of homework before we make the trip!  I used Priceline tonight, which restricted us from choosing the times we fly, but we got two tickets and a rental car for $428. Going through Frontier directly the flight would have been $642, without a rental car. "
