<p>For any of you who follow the website regularly you'll notice that I haven't "put" the car and website up for a sale in a while. Well, it's your lucky day.</p> <p>I'm considering putting the car up for sale, as well as the domain names (www.project240z.com and www.240z.net).</p> <p>In the next week or two I'll get everything together, car and website info, and likely get it listed on Ebay. I'll set it up with a reserve auction, if it meets that reserve then I'll sell it all outright, if not I will likely start parting things out.&#160;</p>
