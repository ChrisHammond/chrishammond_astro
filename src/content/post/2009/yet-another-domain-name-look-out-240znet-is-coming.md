<p>So for a month or so I've been waiting for <a href="https://www.240z.net">www.240z.net</a> to go through the expiration process as the previous owner decided to let it expire. Well today it finally came through and guess who got it!&#160;</p> <p>Woot!</p> <p>Stay tuned as <a href="https://www.240z.net">https://www.240z.net</a> gets built over the coming months. No sneak peeks right now as to what I plan to do with it. It will not just become a replacement for Project240z.com, I don't plan on this site going away.</p> <p>&#160;</p>
