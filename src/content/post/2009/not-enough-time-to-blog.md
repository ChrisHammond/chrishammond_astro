<p>So last year I made it all the way through April with blogging at least once a day, and while it will look like I blogged on the 7th, the date for that post was really on the 6th. This is posting on the 8th, so, I made it 6 days before I missed a blog post :(</p>  <p>I guess I will have to try again NEXT year to blog every day of the year. I tell you, this week has been nuts, if you follow my <a href="https://twitter.com/christoc" target="_blank">twitter feed</a> at all, I posted that I already have 33 hours in our time tracker, after just three days of work. I have a lot left to go, and another book deadline for next week, along with travelling out of town next week. It looks like it will be another busy weekend!</p>  <p>I am going to make time to see a movie with my wife, weâ€™re going to go see Gran Torino on Friday night.</p>
