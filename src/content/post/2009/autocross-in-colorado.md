<p>So last night I posted on the local <a href="https://www.rmsolo.org/" target="_blank">Colorado SCCA Region’s solo website</a> to start asking for input about the various areas we’re looking at moving to. I must admit, they’ve been far more helpful than I expected. It looks like if we end up in Ft. Collins there are a number of SCCA members in the area, but it also means we will likely have to drive 2-2.5 hours to get to the “local” autocross events which are generally held south of Colorado Springs.</p>  <p>I won’t mind the drive, at least I am telling myself that now :) </p>
