<p>So yesterday I got an email from a title company in Colorado with what looked to be documents confirming that our offer on the house had been accepted. I called our agent and he didn't know what was going on so he started making some calls.</p> <p>Apparently the title company jumped the gun, the bank hasn't moved forward with our offer, at least as far as anyone knows so far. So I had about 30 minutes of my hopes being through the roof that we got the house, only to be brought back down to reality after that.</p> <p>Now to try to get back into the patient mode we were in before and wait this process out.</p>
