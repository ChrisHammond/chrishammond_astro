excerpt: "So yesterday I got an email from a title company in Colorado with what looked to be documents confirming that our offer on the house had been accepted. I called our agent and he didn't know what was going on so he started making some calls. Apparently the title company jumped the gun, the bank hasn't moved forward with our offer, at least as far as anyone knows so far. So I had about 30 minutes of my hopes being through the roof that we got the house, only to be brought back down to reality after that. Now to try to get back into the patient mode we were in before and wait this process out."
