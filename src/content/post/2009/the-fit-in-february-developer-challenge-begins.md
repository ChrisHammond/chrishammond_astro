<p>Starting Date: 2/1/2009 <br /> Current Date: 2/1/2009 <br /> Starting Weight: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3242845899/">263.9lbs</a> <br /> Current Weight: 263.9lbs</p> <p>So February First marks the start of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=42735764475">Fit In February Developer Challenge</a>, and I am starting up my fitness goals again, so why not try for the challenge!</p> <p><a target="_blank" href="https://calebjenkins.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/official-rules/">You can read the official rules yourself</a>. There are a couple of ways to attempt to win, I am going to go for all three.</p> <p>1. Most weight lost</p> <p>2. Highest percentage lost</p> <p>3. Most active participant</p> <p>Part of #3 is to create a blog post about the contest at the beginning (check). Post a picture of yourself (See below), a before shot as part of the blog post (check). You can also earn a point a day by twittering about the contest (check). Another way to earn points is to post a video of you participating in the contest (check), I’ve done that below as well.</p> <p>How am I going to win this contest? My exercising as much as possible and controlling what I eat. I’ll try to hit the Wii Fit every day for some Yoga. Natalie and I also signed back up for the YMCA so I’ll be heading there to run/walk and work out, hopefully daily.</p> <p>I really debated whether or not to post a shirtless photo of myself, I would rather not let people see how fat I really am, but then I figured, that might be a motivating factor.</p> <p><strong>Before Photos</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3242847551/"><img height="240" alt="Starting Point for FitFebDev Challenge" width="180" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3391/3242847551_98a48fa782_m.jpg" /></a>&#160;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3243682982/"><img height="240" alt="Starting Point for FitFebDev Challenge" width="180" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3366/3243682982_d5fcb96911_m.jpg" /></a></p> <p><strong>Video</strong></p> <object width="400" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" data="https://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=67090" height="267" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=c090980081&amp;photo_id=3243728762&amp;show_info_box=true" /> <param name="movie" value="https://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=67090" /> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000" /> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="400" height="267" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=c090980081&amp;photo_id=3243728762&amp;flickr_show_info_box=true" allowfullscreen="true" bgcolor="#000000" src="https://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=67090"></embed></object>
