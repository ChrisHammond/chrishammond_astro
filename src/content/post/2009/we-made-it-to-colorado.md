<p>So we made it to Colorado yesterday. We ended up driving from St. Louis to Buena Vista to stay overnight with some of our friends, the Schmidts. They live on <a href="https://www.southmainco.com/" target="_blank">South Main</a> here in Buena Vista, a new development right along the Arkansas River. It’s amazing here, beautiful views and beautiful buildings going up. I’ll try to take some pictures as we head out of town. We’re heading off to Ski Cooper here in a bit.</p>  <p>Our drive up was pretty uneventful, 900+ miles, I’m glad we purchased a Garmin 255W before we left town, it made the trip a breeze, and will come in extremely handy while we spend the next couple of days venturing around the state. Photos and more blogging coming over the next few days.</p>
