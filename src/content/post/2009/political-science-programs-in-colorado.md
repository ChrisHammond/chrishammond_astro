<p>So, for those of you who haven’t heard me mention it before, I’ve always had aspirations of running for office someday. Okay, maybe not always, but growing up I always thought to myself, I can’t do anything wrong so that if I want to run for office one day, I could. Between that thought and my father being a Colonel in the U.S. Air Force I never got myself into any trouble, no drugs, no trouble with the law, etc. Since I’ve managed to keep clean this long I keep thinking I really should look at getting into Politics after we move. Perhaps I’ll look at learning a bit more about political science before I do that though.</p>  <p>I’m finishing up my B.S. in Economics here in St. Louis this spring, that is actually the reason we aren’t moving to Colorado earlier than this summer. After we move though I think I might start looking at taking some more classes. Here’s a link to the <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/Depts/PoliSci/index.html" target="_blank">Political Science program at CSU</a>. I don’t know the first thing about grad school, though I do see I will have to take the GRE to get in. I guess I’ll put this on the list of things to look into as we plan our move to Colorado!</p>
