<p>So a turkey day treat has been bestowed upon us, I hope you weren’t planning on eating all day tomorrow and not getting any work done! <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> 05.02.00 was released late on 11/25/2009, so you can run off to <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke.com</a> now and get it!</p>  <p>Joe Brinkman created a decent blog post with some of the details, <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryId/2416/DotNetNuke-5-2-0-Released.aspx" target="_blank">they can be found here</a>. Here’s my take of what he posted.</p>  <p>New features include the better abilities to create module definitions, and even edit modules via the browser, API enhancements for content localization, the ability to import and export page and module settings, a page output caching provider, and the best new feature of all: the ability to immediately run a scheduled task (that was my suggestion).</p>  <p>For my first full official Daily Tip here on the new website I’ll be posting a blog tomorrow covering How To Upgrade DotNetNuke. A very common question, and actually a pretty easy process, assuming you know the proper steps, this blog post should provide those proper steps.</p>  <p>I’ll be upgrading my personal sites to 5.2.0 over the next day or two. </p>
