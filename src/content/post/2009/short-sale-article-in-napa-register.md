<p>So one of the things you might find with twitter is that if you post messages on there you’ll find people start to follow you. Well lately I’ve been getting real estate professionals following me (<a href="https://twitter.com/christoc/">https://twitter.com/christoc/</a>) because I’ve been tweeting about Short Sales and other things in our hunt for a house in Parker Colorado. Today I visited one of these annoying twitter users and ran across an interesting link about the <a href="https://www.napavalleyregister.com/articles/2009/05/26/business/charles_bogue/doc4a177bd6d7220047851678.txt" target="_blank">Short Sale process in the Napa Register</a> (newspaper). While it doesn’t exactly show you everything involved with a short sale process, it does talk briefly about it, and what changes are available for the process right now.</p>
