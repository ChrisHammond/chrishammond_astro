excerpt: "Apparently people don’t know me well enough to know that I was kidding with my blog post this morning (On April Fools Day)! Sorry for getting everyone’s hopes up about Natalie and I having a baby. We will try in the future, but we aren’t settled down and ready for that yet!  Natalie wanted me to note she had no part in this joke and tells me I am mean."
