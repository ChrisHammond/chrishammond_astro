<p>Yes, I know I have a problem, a domain problem. I won’t bother telling you how many I have, but I did want to create a quick blog post with links to some of the new ones, along with a description of each</p>  <p><a href="https://www.dotnetcommunity.com/" target="_blank">DotNetCommunity.com</a> – I’ve not yet decided what exactly to do with this site yet, but I have a few ideas. We’ll see if I get the time to implement some of them soon! I got this domain from my good buddy <a href="https://www.eduncan911.com/" target="_blank">Eric Duncan</a> who got it off backorder during the summer. It took us three months, but we finally got the transferred!</p>  <p><a href="https://www.mobiledroid.com/" target="_blank">MobileDroid.com</a> – This one I’m still also torn on what to do with. I am thinking about writing some mobile phone applications to run on Google’s Android Operating System. If I do this, the site will likely be used for that.</p>  <p>For a list of other domains I own, and this is NO WHERE NEAR a complete list check out the <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/about">about Chris Hammond</a> page.</p>
