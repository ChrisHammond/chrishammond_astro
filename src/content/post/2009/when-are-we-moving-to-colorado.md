<p>So one of our "questions" on the front page of the website here at <a href="https://www.going2colorado.com">www.going2colorado.com</a> is "When are we moving?". Well, we are planning on moving to Ft. Collins in June or July of 2009. It will all depend on what we find for a house, and when we are able to close on a house. We won't move before May as I am taking classes until the middle of May, after that is done we are fair game to go, pending house.</p> <p>We'll obviously update when we're moving as we get closer to the date! We're definitely looking forward to starting the house hunting process on our <a href="https://www.going2colorado.com/Blog/itemId/103/One-month-until-we-go-to-Colorado-again.aspx">trip coming up later in March!</a></p>
