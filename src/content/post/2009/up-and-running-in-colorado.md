excerpt: "So this will be a quick blog post, but a much needed one nonetheless. We are up and running in Colorado! I’ll post later this week with a full detail of all of our adventures over the past week, but we made it safe and sound, closed on the house, and are now getting through the unpacking process.  I got the office setup today and will begin working tomorrow. Hopefully in the evenings I can get to some much needed unpacking!   A couple of thanks must go out. To our parents, both mine and Natalie’s, thank you for coming to Colorado and helping us! We wouldn’t have been able to get what we did done without you. Auntie Carol, thanks for the wonderful gift, it came today!"
