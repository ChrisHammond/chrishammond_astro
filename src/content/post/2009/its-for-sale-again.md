<p>So this time, I think, I am serious about selling the Datsun. With moving sometime in the next 5-6 months I need to start preparing for the move, and with my work/school/book schedule there is no way I will have time to work on the Datsun in the coming months.</p> <p>I'll post up more info later this week on the sale of the car, but if you're interested let me know. As of right now I will likely have everything I own for the car (minus the Corbeau A4 seats) for sale as a package.</p> <p>1973 Datsun 240Z</p> <p>L28E motor<br /> Megasquirt<br /> 2 transmissions<br /> LOTS&#160;of other stuff including a spare suspension, hatch, and lots of boxes with parts.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>I will try to do a full inventory, or at least a more detailed inventory later on.</p>
