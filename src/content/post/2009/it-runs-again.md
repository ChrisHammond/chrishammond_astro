excerpt: "So today we had a garage sale, nothing that resides in the garage was actually sold, but we did sell a lot of stuff that we wanted to get rid of before the move. Post sale the 240Z got some love. Here's the timeline, without times. Attempt to start the car as is, no dice, turns over but won't fire. Remove the VR sensor, rewire it the opposite way. Nothing, no signal, looks like the EDIS doesn't see it at all anymore. Remove VR sensor plug, replace with a different plug, from the box of EDIS supplies. Crank, what, what you want me to start? Okay, vroom vroom Run around like a chicken with my head cut off, call Whittle and tell him the news. Put a fan on top of the car to blow out all the smoke from the garage Crank crank, damnit, won't start, flooded. Remove the plugs, dry them off, crank it without plugs to try to get rid of fuel, whoops forgot to turn off the injectors Turnoff injectors, crank it again, blow out the cylinders with air from the compressor Insert plugs, wires Crank crank vroom vroom vroom, turbo whistle It was a successful day! So tomorrow I'll get the radiator back on the car, and put the exhaust system on the car, and we'll see what she does then. The car is nowhere near done, but it feels great to have a car that starts again!!!"
