<p>So I'm here in Minneapolis teaching another week of DotNetNuke Training. It's an interesting town, but I'm looking forward to being home again this weekend and working on the Datsun <a href="https://www.project240z.com">www.project240z.com</a></p> <p>Monday it looks like I am driving to Indianapolis for the day to meet with a new client, then driving home Monday night. That'll make for a long day, but I would rather do that then stay over night.</p> <p>Check out my flickr feed for some photos <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/">www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/</a></p> <p>While i've been here I've been trying to finish up a few chapter reviews from the production layouts for the book. I&#160;have one chapter left to review, and Pat has a chapter or two to finish up. After that I&#160;"think" we're done with the book, but we'll see what the publisher says!</p>
