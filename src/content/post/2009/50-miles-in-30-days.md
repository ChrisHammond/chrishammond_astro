excerpt: "So I need a goal in my skating, here it is 50 miles in 30 days. I started yesterday, 6/15, so I've got until 7/15 to reach the goal. Why 50 miles? Well in the past year (after yesterday's skate) I had done just around 50 miles on my K2's. 50 miles in thirty days shouldn't be too hard to do, but the key will be to actually continue to keep skating. As of right now I'm at about 12.6 miles, skating 6.3 yesterday and today both. Yesterday's account is posted on Connect.garmin.com, but today's isn't, apparently my Forerunner didn't charge last night, so it didn't last at all today.  I skated the same route as yesterday, Grant's Trailer, today hurt though. I had to stop and rest for a while, whereas yesterday I felt fine the whole way. I don't know if it was the heat, 90+, the fact that I slept 4.5 hours last night (was up late reskinning dnnvoice.com) or that I had two granola bars and a smoothie to eat all day.  Lesson learned, sleep more, eat better, and move somewhere cooler!  I likely won't skate again until Sunday, at least not outside. I'm hoping to play inline hockey tomorrow night with the old gang. We'll see how I adjust back to hockey skates, it's been a year or so since I last played. "
