excerpt: "So I took the A6 out for its first autocross this past weekend at the RMSolo Winter Series Event #2 held at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park. It was a good time, I must say I didn’t expect to place as well in class as I did (2nd), but i honestly was disappointed that I didn’t win!  Here’s the first run uploaded to YouTube, likely will have more posted later and will update this post with those videos.  Flash Not Installed"
