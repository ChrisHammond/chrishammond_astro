<p>Spent an hour or two yesterday, working in the garage. Cleaned off the hood of the car, which was buried. After that I spent some time cleaning off the workbench, which was also buried. Lots of junk thrown away, and other junk organized.</p> <p>I even got working on car parts, taking apart the intake manifold and trying to get it&#160;cleaned up. It was full of chunks of metal from the explosion back in the summer of 2007. I&#160;think I finally got it cleaned up, and I&#160;hope to put the intake back together this week, and maybe even get started on putting it on the motor.</p> <p>[YouTube:L2CmxC8AGFI]</p>
