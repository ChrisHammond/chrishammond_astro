<p>&#160;So I&#160;had "lost" some bolts for the intake, I found them last week. Today I&#160;think I&#160;figured out I&#160;hadn't lost them, I just didn't realize they were in a bag they were in. Today I spent a little while in the garage getting ready to reassemble the intake and exhaust manifolds on the motor. This video is of that brief work. I'm headed to Orlando Thur/Fri this week, I'll be back late on Friday and hope to spend Saturday and Sunday next weekend putting the motor back together, with the goal of putting the motor in the car the following weekend.</p> <p>[YouTube:EbjEi0sAnEQ]</p>
