<p>We’ve had a good time so far here in Colorado! I can’t believe we didn’t move here earlier. Last weekend my brother came in town for the holiday, we went all over the place. Saturday we went to <a href="https://www.soallmayeat.org/" target="_blank">SAME Cafe</a> for lunch, even though our friends Brad and Libby were out of the state (they run the place)! I gotta remember that they’re always gone for labor day. From there we drove through Denver and up through Boulder before heading up to a dressage barn for Natalie to watch one of her students ride. Greg and I took off to Estes Park for a couple of hours while she did that.</p>  <p>Boy was that a great move, it’s amazing up there, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157622261950716/" target="_blank">look what we got to see</a>! </p>  <p><img title="" alt="Elk in Estes Park by you." src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2554/3891932540_6ca15fbe35.jpg" width="500" height="333" /> <img title="" alt="Bear in Estes Park by you." src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2552/3891145809_5d87f1b3aa.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></p>  <p>Natalie wasn’t too happy that Greg and I got to see a bear out in the wild, she was wanting to see one as well! Maybe she’ll get to see one this weekend.</p>  <p>Sunday morning we got up early and went to Golden to go rock climbing with some of Greg’s friends who were in town. That was a fun time, I did the least climbing, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157622151261801/" target="_blank">but took a lot of pictures</a>! Here’s a shot of Natalie</p>  <p><img title="" alt="Natalie Climbing by you." src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3456/3894168817_1b69e86e4c.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></p>  <p>Sunday afternoon Greg and I hit the Cherry Creek trail, he rode our old garage sale bike, I skated. <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/activity/12751053" target="_blank">Here’s the data from the trip</a></p>  <p>Monday we went to Cherry Creek state park to the shooting range and had some fun shooting at targets there, followed by a hike that evening with the dogs. </p>  <p>We went down to Castlewood Canyon State Park, which is only about 13 miles from our house. We hiked a few miles, unfortunately my Garmin was dead and didn’t record any of it, but I got quite a few photos, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157622174785875/" target="_blank">here are a few of them</a>. It was great having Greg here for a few days, we were worn out by the time he left, I’m still trying to catch up on sleep!</p>  <p>Wednesday I went skating again, <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/activity/12977516" target="_blank">I skated further than I think I ever have before, 11.7 miles</a>. I’m going to try to top that distance in the coming week, maybe even on Saturday!</p>  <p>That’s all for now, I think we’re going to hit Breckenridge on Sunday, hopefully with some hiking in the mountains. We’ve gotta start prepping for the 14’rs, we’re hoping to start doing this fall.</p>
