<p>Got confidence in your all wheel drive vehicle in the snow/ice? Well forget it, it's better to drive without it (confidence)! The quattro got a little sideways today, all the way into and through a light pole. You know how they say most accidents happen close to your house? I was only two blocks from home. Apologies to my neighbor who was with me! And to the neighborhood for taking out a street light, fortunately for me it was only a street light and not the trees, or electrical box nearby.</p>  <p>I've slid in a vehicle before, but never like this, totally hopeless and unable to do anything. Alright, maybe once like that, and you might remember how that turned out (see photo)</p>  <p><a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/1283506466/" title="STLDriversSchool_0867"><img alt="STLDriversSchool_0867" border="0" src="//static.flickr.com/1293/1283506466_34e5574835_m.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>Here's the carnage of today's little mishap.</p>  <p><a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/4226736202/" title="Projectquattro post pole"><img alt="Projectquattro post pole" border="0" src="//static.flickr.com/4022/4226736202_443478c277_m.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>And of course the light pole.</p>  <p><a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/4226623836/" title="Lunchtime carnage"><img alt="Lunchtime carnage" border="0" src="//static.flickr.com/2690/4226623836_af79403e10_m.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>Lesson learned, another expensive one likely, but learned nonetheless.</p>
