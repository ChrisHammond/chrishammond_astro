excerpt: "So today is our last day in Colorado. We actually are already headed home, we left Denver this evening around 9pm and shortly ago stopped in Limon Colorado for the night. It’s snowing here, and was the whole trip, so we’ll camp out here tonight and see what the roads are like in the morning.  We spent today looking around at three dressage barns south of Denver. We saw a few nice places and talked to some very good resources for Natalie. We haven’t narrowed any decisions down yet as to where we will end up, but we got a lot of good info from today’s visits.  We also went to the golf course at Bear Dance where my former boss (form 1995/1996) works as the head professional there. It was a beautiful course, though there were only two trucks in the lot due to the weather! From there we headed west, doing a little off-roading in the Envoy.  To cap off the night we went to dinner with three of my fraternity brothers, it was a great time catching up with the guys. I am looking forward to getting to spend more time hanging out with them over the next few visits to Colorado!  We’ll have some more photos and such posted tomorrow night or the next day. We’ll be getting up early in the morning and hopefully heading to St. Louis, assuming the weather is good!"
