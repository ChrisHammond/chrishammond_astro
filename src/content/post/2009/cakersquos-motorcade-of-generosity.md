<p>So if you are a cake fan (<a href="https://www.cakemusic.com">www.cakemusic.com</a>) you might find this next blurb a little interesting. I got this in an email from the Cake Newsletter last night</p>  <blockquote>   <p>CAKE is pleased to offer their &quot;Motorcade of Generosity&quot; on a high quality 180 gram orange vinyl disc. Both a &quot;Motorcade&quot; poster and a digital download card for the full album will be included inside the jacket. In advance of the forthcoming black vinyl, this orange vinyl collector's edition album is available for $15 for a limited time only at <a href="https://www.cakemusic.com/mog.html">https://www.cakemusic.com/mog.html</a> while supplies last! </p> </blockquote>  <p>I’ve ordered my copy! I will probably even buy a record player just for this one album, though I do have a Korn album in Vinyl as well.</p>  <p>“Motorcade of Generosity” was the first Cake album I ever owned, it started it all.</p>
