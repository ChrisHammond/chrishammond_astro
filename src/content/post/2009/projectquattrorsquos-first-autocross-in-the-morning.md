<p>I’m up getting ready for the quattro’s first autocross tomorrow morning. This will likely be the first time I have ever autocrossed in November, and I’ve been autocrossing for almost 10 years now. Here’s to hoping the A6 makes it there and back in one piece! Hoping to have some conecam video of the action as well, we’ll see.</p>
