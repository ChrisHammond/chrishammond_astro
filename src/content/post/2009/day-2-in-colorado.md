excerpt: "So Natalie and headed off from Buena Vista today towards Ski Cooper. We barely made it out of town when we realized we hadn’t left the Schmidt’s xmas card, so we turned around and drove it back. We hand delivered theirs because it was the first one returned to us due to them changing addresses.  So we took off to Ski Cooper and made it up within about an hour, maybe less, from  Buena Vista, taking in some amazing sights along the way.   We had a blast at Ski Cooper, it’s not the fanciest or largest of places, but we hit the slopes for $75, two half day lift tickets and rental skis/boots for Natalie. It’s hard to beat that price!      We’ll have more pictures later, I think my card reader is in the car.  After a few hours on the slopes we planned to head to Ft. Collins for the night, with the intention of starting to look at horse stables tomorrow. Well, on the way out of Ski Cooper I decided I wanted to take a picture of the mountains. Fortunately for us another guy named Chris came by in his F250 and pulled us out of the snowbank I thought would be a great place to park for the picture. Needless to say I didn’t get the picture, but I did get to have some fun trying to get the Envoy out of the snow. FYI 4wd doesn’t do much in 3-4 feet of snow :D   So we’re in Ft. Collins, now, we’re going to head out in the morning and look at a few stables Natalie found online. We also need to try to hit an Autozone and get the Envoy scanned. The check engine light came on on our way to Cooper this morning. I don’t imagine it’s anything major, but we’ll see what a code scanner says tomorrow."
