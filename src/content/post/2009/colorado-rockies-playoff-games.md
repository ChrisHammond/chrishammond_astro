excerpt: "So tonight was our first night at a playoff game here in Colorado. It was COLLLLLLLDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD. Really cold, from what I hear, record tying cold for a playoff game! We only made it 5 innings, the game didn’t start till 8pm, we left around 10:15 after the 5th.  I’m off again tomorrow to the afternoon game, at least this time the first pitch is at 4:07pm, 4 hours earlier than tonight. Hopefully it’ll be a tad warmer!  Here’s a photo from our nosebleed seats (very last row)  "
