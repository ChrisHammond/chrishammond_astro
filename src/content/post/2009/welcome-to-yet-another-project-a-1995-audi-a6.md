excerpt: "So here we are, a new domain, a new project and a new car! This car, while a \"project\" isn't a project like that other car is. Since we moved to Colorado we figured it would be a good idea if we had AWD/4wd vehicles, so we sold our 2004 F350 and traded in our 2004 GMCÂ Envoy for a 2008 F250 FX4 last week. That put us down to a one (running) vehicle family, I couldn't take it! I'd been looking around for a while for another ride and came across this Audi not even 5 minutes from our house. It's got just under 130k miles."

<p>So here we are, a new domain, a new project and a new car! This car, while a "project" isn't a project <a href="https://www.project240z.com/">like that other car is</a>.</p> <p style="text-align: left">So here she is, a 1995 Audi A6 quattro.<a title="1995 Audi A6 quattro by chrishammond" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4009771355/"><img class="pc_img" border="0" alt="1995 Audi A6 quattro by chrishammond" align="right" width="240" height="180" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2527/4009771355_bec35232fb_m.jpg" /></a></p> <p style="text-align: left">Since we moved to Colorado we figured it would be a good idea if we had AWD/4wd vehicles, so we sold our 2004 F350 and traded in our 2004 GMC&#160;Envoy for a 2008 F250 FX4 last week.

It's got just under 130k miles.</p> <p>It does need a few things, the windshield is cracked (as is every other used car windshield in Colorado), and the expansion tank for the radiator was leaking causing a nice burning coolant smell. The driver's door speaker is blown, which I figured would be an easy replacement until I figured out that the bose speakers in the door have a HUGE chamber attached to them.</p> <p>I ordered a new expansion tank and put it in the car today (it's in the video) and then I spent an hour or so washing the car and using a clay bar to clean up some of the marks in the paint. I'm going to put some wax on the car this weekend, we'll see how well the cleaner wax works on the faded sections of the roof.</p> <p>Check out the first Projectquattro.com video!&#160;</p> <p>[YouTube:-I5xJMsOqZk]</p>
