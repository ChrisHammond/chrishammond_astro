<p>So the first week of school for my final semester is over. So far both classes seem like they will be alright, and actually interesting to me. They’re both econ related, but one is a public policy class, and the other is a political science class. Perhaps after these two classes I will have a better idea of if I really want to try my hand at politics in the future. I have a feeling I will still have a strong desire to do so. A quick glance at the the Colorado State University website shows at Political Science masters program… Not that I’ve finished my BS (hey, it’ll be 14 years when I finish in May) but maybe taking some classes at CSU would be an interesting thing to do.</p> <p>I think that will generate another blog post over on <a href="https://www.going2colorado.com">www.going2colorado.com</a> tonight…</p>
