<p>So now that we’ve moved it was time to change up the domain name a little, going2colorado.com was so first half 2009. Welcome to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ourcoloradolife.com/">OurColoradoLife.com</a>!</p> <p>All this time we’ve been using the site to track our adventures with the move, and now that the move is over it is time for the site to grow. So what comes next for the site? I’m overhauling the Flickr photo module I wrote for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a>, hopefully that will be done in the next week or so. We will also be adding some sections to the site. One of the things we want to do now that we are in Colorado is hike the 14ers, so I’ll be setting up a page and some features on the site to track our progress. There are over 50 fourteen thousand foot peaks in Colorado, our goal is to eventually hike them all!</p> <p>People were giving me trouble for continuing to tweet about our Colorado adventures and reference #going2colorado so today, that hashtag gets replaced with #OurCoLife I also registered <a href="https://www.ourcolife.com">https://www.ourcolife.com</a> just for the hashtag ;)</p> <p>Stay tuned as OurColoradoLife blossoms, we love it here in this beautiful state, hopefully we can impart to you even a small portion of the beauty that this state offers.</p>
