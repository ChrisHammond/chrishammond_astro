excerpt: "So we heard back on our offer, they countered with 97% of the asking price, taking into account the closing costs we asked to cover but leaving out the hot tub, washer and dryer we asked to be included. We offered 89% with $6k in closing costs, and the washer/dryer/hot tub.  So now what? I think we raise our offer by $10k and continue to ask for the washer/dryer/hot tub. If they counter again we might go up a bit, but we’ll raise the closing costs.  I hate house shopping! I just want it to be over so we can get our move on."
