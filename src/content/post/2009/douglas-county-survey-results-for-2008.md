<p>Sitting in class tonight I started surfing around to look at information about Parker Colorado, where we plan on moving, as well as Douglas County which is where Parker is located.</p>  <p>Looking at the Douglas County website at <a href="https://www.douglas.co.us">www.douglas.co.us</a> I came across survey results from the residents of the county for 2008.</p>  <p><a title="https://www.douglas.co.us/documents/Douglas%20County_2008_Survey.pdf" href="https://www.douglas.co.us/documents/Douglas%20County_2008_Survey.pdf">https://www.douglas.co.us/documents/Douglas%20County_2008_Survey.pdf</a></p>  <p>I find it interesting to look down through the results, I wonder which part of 2008 the results were taken, as they are pretty positive about the economy. I just did some digging and it looks like it was taken in April 2008, so hopefully theÂ  2009 survey will be taken and results out in the next few months to see how it looks.</p>
