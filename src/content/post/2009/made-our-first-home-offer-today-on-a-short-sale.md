excerpt: "So today Natalie and I signed our first home offer on a house here in Parker Colorado. It’s a beautiful house, on top of a nice hill, great view of the mountains, and a nice park area out back.    It’s a short sale, so we’re anxious to see how it all turns out. We aren’t expecting to hear much anytime soon on it. Of course we would love to, but I imagine it will take a while, fortunately for us we aren’t rushed in our move.   We also looked around at a number of ranch homes today. We found one yesterday that would be great except the garage isn’t big enough for 3 cars, even though it was listed as a 3 car. Some of the ones today are definitely interesting, but we’re hoping that this one we made an offer on is the house for us.  We’re flying back to St. Louis in the morning, so I’ll keep this short."
