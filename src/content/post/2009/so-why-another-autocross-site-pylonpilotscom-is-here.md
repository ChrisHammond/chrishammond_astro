excerpt: "So one question you might have in regards to PylonPilots.com is: why would the world need another autocross website? Well, at one point in time SOLO2.ORG was THE place to go to get information about our sport. I have multiple magazines that published articles about Autocross and made reference to what was then SOLO2.ORG. Hell, I found them all as I went through things as we pack for our move to Colorado (https://www.going2colorado.com) I want that again, I want to have THE website where people go for information about Autocross. So why not just reuse SOLO2.ORG? Well, for one thing, the software on the site was hurting, ever since the switch to that software in 2006 or 2007 the site has slowly died. People quit using it, content went away, and references to the site stopped happening. (continue reading!)"
