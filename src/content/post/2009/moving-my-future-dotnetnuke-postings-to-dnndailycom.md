<p>So I’ve got way too many blogs,&#160; so why not add another one? I’m going to be posting blogs here on <a title="DotNetNuke Tips and Tricks" href="https://www.DNNDaily.com">DNNDaily.com</a> now as I work to get back into the swing of posting a new <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> tip every day of the business week (holidays and weekends may see an occasional post).</p>  <p>I will likely no longer make any blog posts on <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/">https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/</a> except for one final “this is it” post to finish things off over there. As with most of my blog postings the posts here will be aggregated to my main personal website, <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/">https://www.chrishammond.com/</a>.</p>  <p>At this point in time I am going break things up with Tags, though I’ll have quite a few, the four primary tags (topics) will be <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tags/tags/Development.aspx" rel="tag">Development</a>, <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tags/tags/skinning.aspx" rel="tag">Skinning</a>, <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tags/tags/administration.aspx" rel="tag">Administration</a> and <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/tags/tags/events.aspx" rel="tag">Events</a>. If you click on those links right now you’ll find a list of all posts tagged with those, which will only include this first one! At least until I get some other posts generated.</p>  <p>I’ve got a list of topics started, now i just need to start whittling away at the list, and also adding to it, as I write up new DotNetNuke Tips and Tricks here on <a href="https://www.dnndaily.com/">DNNDaily.com</a>.</p>
