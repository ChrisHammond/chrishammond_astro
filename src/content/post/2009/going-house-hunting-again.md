<p>Natalie and I are headed off to Parker Colorado again this weekend to look at houses. So here’s a recap of what happened originally.</p>  <p>1. The original offer we made on the short sale house in Parker was rejected by the owners.</p>  <p>2. The second offer was accepted by the owners, but after a month rejected by the bank.</p>  <p>3. We’re likely to make another offer on the short sale, less than our second rejected offer to try to get the bank to do another appraisal and see if they’ll come down on what they want for the house, it’s about 20k more than we are willing to spend.</p>  <p>Beyond that additional offer, which we can get out of at any time, we’re going to make another trip out there to start the process over of looking at houses, we might look at one we looked at previously, but likely will be seeing totally different houses. We upped our search price range to see if we can find something above our range and make a lower offer to try to them within our range. We are also going to look at a few places a bit farther out of town that have 1-2 acres, everything we’ve looked at up to this point has been 1/3 acre or less.</p>  <p>While we’re out there we hope to spend a day just looking around, we really haven’t had much time to cruise around the area the past few trips. I may even take my K2 inline skates and hit a trailer if the weather cooperates. We are also slated to pick up some gokart engines for the <a href="https://www.kenuam.com/" target="_blank">Kenuam’s</a> as <a href="https://www.kenuam.com/Blog/tabid/65/EntryID/45/Default.aspx" target="_blank">they’ve picked up a new hobby</a> and found some parts on the Denver Craigslist.</p>  <p>We’ll take plenty of pics of the trip this weekend. We’re actually driving this time, booked a rental car through priceline for <$20/day with that and the price of gas we should save some money over flying, and be more flexible on when we come back. We’ll either leave Sunday or Monday and head back to STL.</p>
