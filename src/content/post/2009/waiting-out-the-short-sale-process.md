<p>So we’re about three weeks into, or just about, the Short Sale process on our second offer on the house in Parker, Colorado. For those of you who don’t know me, I am an impatient bastard! I hate waiting, so this process is agonizing. I’m actually impressed though, both Natalie and I haven’t gotten our hopes up TOO much on this house working out. Sure, we would love it to work out, it really would be the perfect house for us, exactly what we wanted, views, big garage, unfinished basement, decent yard, great kitchen, beautiful house with the “Colorado” look on the outside.</p>  <p>But we know that the price we offered may be too low to get into the neighborhood, had it been two years ago when the house was brand new there would be no way we’d even be able to consider the house. Now with the potential for a short sale we stand a chance, though it’s probably only a little chance. </p>  <p>So we just remain here, waiting to see what happens. According to the seller’s agent, he thinks, or was told, he may here something by Tuesday or Wednesday of this week. We will see if that happens, like I said, we’re trying not to get our hopes up.</p>  <p>We’ve started listing off all the stuff we need to get rid of before we move, now to just have a garage sale and start getting rid of things. The neighborhood here in St. Louis usually has one every spring, but we haven’t heard anything about it yet, so maybe we’ll have to have our own.</p>  <p>If there are any friends who need a Hutch, or Kitchen Table (only 2 chairs though) let us know, we aren’t planning on taking my old table and hutch, they match though, and are Ethan Allen if I recall correctly. We’ll also have a microwave (best MW I’ve ever owned, can cook a bag of popcorn complete in 2 minutes), and lots of other random stuff.</p>
