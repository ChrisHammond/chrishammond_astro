<p>I started this list a while back, and decided I would go ahead and finish it, and post it online. Thanks to <a href="https://www.oliverhine.com" target="_blank">Oliver Hine for #9</a></p>  <p>As someone who runs, edits or develops for a <a href="https://www.christoc.com/dotnetnuke" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> website, these are 10 things you should always stick to.</p>  <p>1) Thou shalt back up the files and database before: upgrades, extension installs, extension removals   <br /> 2) Thou shalt not delete a page, ever    <br /> 3) Thou shalt not rename a page, ever    <br /> 4) Thou shalt not move a page, ever    <br /> 5) Thou shalt not &quot;display on all pages&quot; without thinking through your actions    <br /> 6) Thou shalt not disparage VB.net or C#    <br /> 7) Thou shalt not resize images via HTML    <br /> 8) Thou shalt not run old versions of     <br /> 9) Thou shalt not paste from Microsoft Word without scrubbing the content    <br /> 10) Thou shalt not use objectQualifier if at all possible (in development I do recommend it)</p>  <p>So, now the question is, should I put reasons for each of them? Or just leave them as is</p>
