<p>If you are attempting to flash you Verizon Galaxy Nexus device with a new rom, perhaps a CyanogenMod nightly build like I was trying to do today, but you keep getting the little green android guy lying down, with a red triangle and a white exclamation mark, you probably need to reflash the recovery on your phone.</p>  <p>I was following these instructions for flashing my device (<a title="https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_toro" href="https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_toro">https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_toro</a>) and kept running into that problem. In the section for “Installing recovery using fastboot” Step 7 says you might need to go right into recovery mode after flashing the recovery, well if you haven’t copied the ZIP file(s) to your device yet, going into recovery immediately likely won’t do you any good.</p>  <p>To fix that, what I had to do was flash the recovery again AFTER performing step 2 in “Installing CyanogenMod from recovery”. Then I could proceed with Step 3. </p>  <p>Hopefully this helps you out if you’re running into the Android with Red Triangle and White Exclamation like I was.</p>
