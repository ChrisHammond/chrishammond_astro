<p style="font: inherit;">Today Garmin has released two new, very cool, products. The&nbsp;<a href="https://cjh.am/UDc0Ec" style="font: inherit;">Garmin Edge 510</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://cjh.am/UDcwlz" style="font: inherit;">Garmin Edge 810</a>. You can find out more information about them with some of the information below.</p> <p style="font: inherit;">The key feature for the two new devices are the ability to pair the devices with your phone, and using that connection, upload your training data real time to Garmin Connect. I am curious to see if this feature gets extended and used by other services such as Strava. I know there is already a Strava app for Android and IPhone, but imagine if the Strava app talked to your Garmin device directly.</p> <a href="https://www.bicycletips.com/tips/aid/34">Read More at www.bicycletips.com</a>
