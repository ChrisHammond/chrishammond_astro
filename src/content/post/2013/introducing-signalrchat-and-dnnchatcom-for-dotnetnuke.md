<p><a href="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//windows-live-writer/introducing-signalrchat-for-dotnetnuke_13908/image_6.png" rel="lightbox[thispost]"><img style="display: inline; background-image: none; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; float: left;" title="image" alt="image" align="left" src="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//Windows-Live-Writer/Introducing-SignalRChat-for-DotNetNuke_13908/image_thumb_2.png" width="244" height="86" /></a>Just because I don't work for DotNetNuke anymore, doesn't mean I am done with this fabulous platform. For my new gig at <a href="https://www.clubready.com">ClubReady</a> (, I started this past Monday) I am not doing <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> related work, but I am still working on the web. I was doing some research and testing with <a href="https://www.signalr.net">SignalR</a>, if you want to find out what it is, click on the link there and check it out. In short, it allows for webpages and apps to have an open pipe between the client and the server, allowing you to send information back and forth with ease.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Because I was working with it at the office, and I wanted to learn more, late last week (I think around 1130pm on Tuesday night) I decided I was going to see if I could get it working inside of a DotNetNuke module. 30 Minutes later the <a href="https://www.christoc.com/projects/signalrchatmodule">SignalRChat module for DotNetNuke</a> was functional and I had created a project on the DotNetNuke Forge/Codeplex, for it.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Since then I have put out two additional releases of the module, v00.00.02 and v00.00.03, and have had a variety of people connect to the demo website and test it. You can see the module in action on my newly created website <a href="https://www.dnnchat.com/">https://www.dnnchat.com/</a> </p> <p style="text-align: left;">So what is the SignalRChat module? It is a very simple chat module for DotNetNuke (requires DNN 7.0.2 or newer) that provides a few basic features.</p> <ul>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">Simple chat interface</div>     </li>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">Ability to use Display Name from users that are logged in</div>     </li>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">Ability for users to change their name in the chat with &ldquo;/nick NEWNAME&rdquo; entered into the chat window</div>     </li>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">Shows connections and disconnections</div>     </li>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">Admins can set a &ldquo;Message of The Day&rdquo; that displays for a user when they connect to the chat.</div>     </li>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">Shows the total number of user's connected</div>     </li>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">Logs all connections and messages in the DNN database using DAL2</div>     </li>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">All HTML is stripped from entry</div>     </li>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">Completely open source (C#)</div>     </li>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">MIT open source license</div>     </li> </ul> <p style="text-align: left;">As of right now I have a few additional features I would like to add to the module, in all likely hood they will be there in a couple of days</p> <ul>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">Ability to restrict the use of /nick and force the use of DNN Display Name</div>     </li>     <li>     <div style="text-align: left;">Hyperlinks should be parsed and activated</div>     </li> </ul> <p>Additional features will also likely be added. If you'd like to contribute ideas for the module put them in the <a href="https://signalrchat.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic">Issues area of the Codeplex page</a>, you can also ask questions and discuss the module in the <a href="https://signalrchat.codeplex.com/discussions">Discussions are on Codeplex</a>.</p> <h3>Download</h3> <p>Want to download the <a href="https://www.christoc.com/projects/signalrchatmodule">SignalRChat</a> module? Head on over to the <a href="https://signalrchat.codeplex.com/releases">Downloads page</a>.</p> <p>So now, the next question most developers will ask, how do you implement SignalR in DotNetNuke modules? I promise I will blog about that later this week, though I assure you it is pretty darn easy to do with DotNetNuke 7.</p> <h2>Announcing dnnCHAT.com</h2> <p><a href="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//Windows-Live-Writer/Introducing-SignalRChat-for-DotNetNuke_13908/image_4.png" rel="lightbox[thispost]"><img style="display: inline; background-image: none; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; float: right;" title="image" alt="image" align="right" src="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//Windows-Live-Writer/Introducing-SignalRChat-for-DotNetNuke_13908/image_thumb_1.png" width="244" height="108" /></a>Looking for a way to showcase the SignalRChat module I registered <a href="https://www.dnnCHAT.com/">dnnCHAT.com</a> a couple of days ago and tonight got it setup as a demo site for the module. Though I envision this website being more than just a demo of the module, I hope that people use it to learn more about DotNetNuke. With all the community aspects of DotNetNuke.com, there isn't really anything conducive to real-time discussions, I hope that <a href="https://www.dnnchat.com">dnnCHAT</a> helps people to talk more about DNN.</p> <p><strong>To get things kicked off, on Monday February 25th, at 10:30pm EST I will be sitting down in the chat room, along with </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/oliverhine"><strong>@OliverHine</strong></a><strong> and we will be answering DNN related questions</strong>. I hope to see more of these types of things happen in the future, but we need to get the first one under our belt and see how the module works with a number of people connected.</p>
