excerpt: "It is with a bit of sadness, and a bit of excitement that I put together this blog post. After February 15th I will no longer be an employee of DotNetNuke. I’ve been with the company almost 3 years (March 1st would have been my anniversary), and I’ve been working with the project for the past 10+ years and worked for one of DotNetNuke’s leading partners, Engage Software, for almost 6 years before starting with DNNCorp."

<p>It is with a bit of sadness, and a bit of excitement that I put together this blog post. After February 15th I will no longer be an employee of <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a>. I’ve been with the company almost 3 years (March 1st would have been my anniversary), and I’ve been working with the project for the past 10+ years and worked for one of DotNetNuke’s leading partners, <a href="https://www.engagesoftware.com">Engage Software</a>, for almost 6 years before starting with DNNCorp.</p>  <p>So why is February 15th my last day? To be honest, I’m a military brat, I thrive for change (we moved a lot as a kid), and it is just time for me to do something else. I have been exploring the idea of getting back into more software development over the past year, as opposed to the training side of things, and have decided that I would like to work outside of the CMS space for a while.</p>  <p>That being said, I will miss a lot about DNNCorp and am very thankful for the opportunity that the company has provided for myself and my family for the past three years. I don’t foresee leaving the DNN space completely, I have a lot of websites that run on DotNetNuke, and I will continue to work on those, and new ones in the future. You will still see me, in the <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Forums.aspx">Forums</a>, in the <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Community-Exchange.aspx">Community Exchange</a>, <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/">blogging</a> and attending DotNetNuke events around the world. But I will once again be just another community member, doing DNN for fun, for hobby, for various projects, back to my roots, the way things started for me with DNN, building websites because I wanted to build them.</p>  <p><strong>What about the Training Program with DotNetNuke?</strong> Have no fear, the DNN Training program isn’t going away, it is in good hands going forward with a team of resources that will be devoted to it’s further enrichment. Stay tuned of future announcements regarding the training program on <a href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke.com</a>.</p>  <p>There are a lot of new exciting things coming from DotNetNuke Corporation over the next few years, I look forward to seeing those and using them as well.</p>  <p><strong>What’s next for me?</strong> I’ll be working for a small software company in St. Louis County Missouri, not far from our house (bike commute here I come). I’m excited about the team of folks they have at the company and the challenge of the software product they have developed. They don’t have a foosball table in the office yet, but I do plan to push for that as soon as I get on board. The time spent around the <a href="https://www.dnnfoos.com">DNNFoos</a> table was some of the most fun I’ve had, and I look forward to sharing that experience with a new set of friends. That and I still plan to beat up on <a href="https://www.willstrohl.com">Will Strohl</a> at Foosball whenever I get the opportunity.</p>  <p>Please feel free to connect on <a href="https://lnkd.in/HMj8HH">LinkedIn</a>, or follow my future blog posts at <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com/">ChrisHammond.com</a>.</p>
