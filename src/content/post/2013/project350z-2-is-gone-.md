<p>Well, the car was in my hands for almost three years (2 months shy), that is longer than I&#39;ve owned any car since the first Project350z left my hands in September 2006.</p>  <p>One day perhaps I will own another 350z, it isn&#39;t in the plans right now, but never say never I suppose.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/8212015143/" style="font: inherit;" title="the last car photo of #project350z by chrishammond, on Flickr"><img alt="the last car photo of #project350z" height="375" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8349/8212015143_91b72d00ac.jpg" style="font: inherit;" width="500" /></a></p>  <a href="https://www.autocrossblog.com/project350z-2-is-gone">Read More at www.autocrossblog.com</a>
