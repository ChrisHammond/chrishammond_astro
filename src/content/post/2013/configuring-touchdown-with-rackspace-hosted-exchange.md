excerpt: "At the new gig we use RackSpace’s Hosted Exchange service for our email. I wanted to get that email setup on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, and have already purchased a license for TouchDown, which in my experience, is a great Android app for using Exchange email. The problem I ran into is that figuring out what information to use in the TouchDown configuration based on RackSpace’s cryptic instructions was hard to figure out. After far too many different things tried, I finally figured it out. "
