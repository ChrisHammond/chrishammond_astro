<P>Baseball season is rolling to a close, and the best time of year is beginning to start! The post season! Last years post season may never be topped, but this years looks like it could come close. The Sox are a half game back from the Yankees for the AL East, because they had a rain out yesterday against the Blue Jays.</P> <P>The Cardinals are rolling again this year, and I've already got tickets to 4 playoff games, we'll see how many I get to go to this year. <A href="https://www.krekelerjewelers.com/">Jeff Krekeler</A> will use the other tickets I have.</P> <P>Fantasy football is in full swing. I'm leading 3-0 in the league that Brand got me into this year. I've slaughtered folks the past two weeks, which is very good. Now if I can just keep that up for 12-13 more weeks.</P>
