<P>Dave and I drove down to Springfield Missouri for the 3/6 <a title="autocross website" href="https://www.solo2.org/" target="_blank">autocross</a> held at Price Cutter Park.</P> <P>I drove the Z down, he drove his Maxima, hauling the tires for the Z down there. Ended up being a good event, quite small, so we got plenty of runs. Dave coned the hell out of the car, as he always does driving my cars. I was I believe 2nd FTD, I couldn't seem to drop the second I needed to get FTD, though I know the car was more than capable of doing so.</P> <P>More on the car/week later on.</P>
