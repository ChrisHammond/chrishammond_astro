Well, somehow I have gotten back into doing web sites for friends! I'm currently working on 3, already setup one for <A href="https://www.feloneblog.com/">Brian</A>, setup one for <A href="https://www.phormyka.com/">Greg</A> but need to tweak it to give it a good look and then train him on how to use it. I've also gotta set one up for Faye, but hers will have to wait till she buys a domain name, and so I can come up with a look/feel for her site as well. I'm using the new <A href="https://www.communityserver.org/">CommunityServer</A> release from <A href="https://www.telligentsystems.com">Telligent Systems</A> for these sites, it allows for blogs/galleries/forums all in one app, and once I get the skinning down the sites will be pretty <A href="https://www.twopimps.com">pimp</A>!
