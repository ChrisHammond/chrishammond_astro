<P>The family is all stuck in Lexington Massachusets right now due to weather! Fun fun fun. </P> <P>Check out some of the photos of all of the snow we got, I'm not sure how much we actually got, probably 2 feet, some of the drifts are up to 4-5 ft though, kind of neat.</P> <P><A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/gallery/albums/67">https://www.chrishammond.com/gallery/albums/67</a></p> <p>i was supposed to fly out this evening. Now I'm scheduled to leave around Noon tomorrow.</P>
