<P>I just got through doing something I haven't done in years! Playing my saxophone! I had Mark (coworker) pick up some reeds at his last drum lesson so I could play again.</P> <P>I miss it! Now to see if I just keep up with the playing. I used to be really good, but now I'm back into the &#8220;I suck&#8221; category. I'll have to find myself a music stand and some practice work (will search the net), see if I can't get back into music, which was once my only love.</P>
