excerpt: "A quick (longer than planned) writeup, from a BS perspective The surface was concrete, VERY rough on tires, kinda slick but still not a bad surface over all, a little breakup after day 1, patches before day 2. The weather was pretty windy on Friday, not as much wind on Saturday, by Sunday the wind has switched and was blowing form the east. Not near as strong as Friday though. Both mornings were chilly, saturday was 36 degrees when Heat 1 started at 7:55am. By 1:30 it was ~60 degrees out, Sunny, with a light wind.The event ran very smoothly, great job by the Arkansas Region and SCCA staff. Only two event recommendation I would have, the front gate didn't appear to be staffed very well during the non-heat times (not sure during heats). The other being the choice of Saturday night dinner locations. It was a little too small for the number of folks we had at the event, just a thought for next year  There were 185 drivers, I worked first heat in the trailer doing radio, which was nice because I got to stay inside where it was nice and toasty  BS ran Second heat both days, there were 10 drivers (2 M3s (4 drivers) 1 RX-8, a Red 350Z, a Brickyard 350Z and my Daytona Blue 350Z with myself and Andy driving). Andy and I were trying out some Kumho 710s, some very large Kumho 710s! We managed to squeeze 275s on all four corners, including the 7.5\" front wheels, I ended up installing a spacer up front just to be sure we didn't rub, I don't think it would have been an issue though even without the spacer. After first runs on Saturday I had a mid 46, with Ashir (sp?) running a 46.8 though I thought I had about a 1.5 second lead on the class. Andy, my codriver, I believe had a cone on his first run. Second runs Andy ended up with some car troubles. Just before the big sweeper (turn around) the car died. We're not sure how, or why, but it wouldn't start back up right away. The first though people had (course workers) was that it ran out of gas, which wasn't really an option as it had 1/2 tank of gas. I generally run with little to no gas in the car, but didn't plan so well for this trip and filled up before making the 240 mile drive to Walnut Ridge, which left me with over half a tank. I tried to burn off some gas driving through town, and then hoped to use up some at the practice event on Friday.  Andy got the car started back up and came off after his 2nd run with a DNF due to the mechanical difficulties. We looked the car over, revved id, smelled it, looked underneath, nothing appeared out of place or missing/broken. I went out on my second run and the car ran fine, though I was a bit slower, I think due to worrying about how the car would react. Andy went out for his third run and jumped in front of my first run by about .15 seconds. I went out on my third run hoping to best his time, which I was unable to do. I knew this would happen, as I seem to have problems improving runs at big events, I almost always have my best run up front and then I guess over think everything else. Ashir ended up dropping some more time on his third run and finished behind me for the first day by .066 seconds. Sunday brought a new day. I went out on my first run and put about a second on the field, but got a late cone call in the final slolom to put me back into 2nd or 3rd I believe. Andy's first run was one of the fastest in the class, and unfortunately for him was his fastest clean time of the day due to other difficulties. 2nd run he went out and blew the course away, he knocked off 2 seconds from his time and about 1 second from mine, but yet again, a late cone call came into play. Ashir didn't quite seem to be able to get a good handle on the car on Sunday, I believe due to some changes they tried making to the sway bar the night before.  My second run I went out, sped up a bit, and cleaned up my run, enough to actually take the class for the day. Andy went out for his third run intent on whiping the floor with me, and he may very well have,..."

Andy went out for his third run intent on whiping the floor with me, and he may very well have, except for two things. He killed a cone right before the first slolom entry, and then shortly after that slolom the car died yet again for him. He finished with a 72 something, plus 1. I went out on my third run and dropped ~.5 seconds off my second run, just to add a little padding, Ashir was making his third run when I started, and I had the radio on to listen to his time to know how fast I needed to run, if faster than my second run. I however, turned off the radio right before my run because I decided not to distract myself with listening to the radio.</P> <P>Overall I was very pleased with the car. The tires were excellent, though possibly a little mushy. The new sway bar seems to have helped the inside tirespin a bit, it hasn't completely solved that problem though. Other than for some reason the car shutting off on Andy two times the car was perfect IMO all weekend. I do want to try to figure out what the heck Andy was doing to make it shut off though, if for nothing else to not do it myself.</P> <P>As for me winning my first National Tour, I'm very excited about that, pleased with my performance, though I know there was more time out there, and I still need to work on improving my times after my first run. Now I'm trying to figure out how to get to the Atlanta Tour which I hadn't planned on going to!</P> <P>I'll try to document more of the weekend with video, G-Tech data, and pictures early this week, possibly in the next day or so, you can find more info on </P> <P><A href="https://www.solo2.org/Default.aspx?tabid=27">https://www.solo2.org/Default.aspx?tabid=27</A></P>
