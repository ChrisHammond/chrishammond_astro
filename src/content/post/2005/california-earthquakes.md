<P>Well, I'm in California for my reunion, and it's the <A href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8247661/">earth quake season</A>!</P> <P>Faye, Janelle and I are headed up the coast today in the rented Wrangler. Hopefully we don't get any quakes that cause any of those silly landslides that California seems to like to get as well!</P>
