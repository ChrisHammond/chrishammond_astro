<p>Check out the blog over on the November Learning Communities site by someone from the Trinity school which was damaged heavily by Hurricane Katrina.</p>  <h2>Update May 2024</h2> <p> Apparently the November Learning Communities website is no more. I don't know what happened to it, or if it launched on some other domain, but the old one (links removed) no longer exist. The original post has been updated to remove those links. </p>
