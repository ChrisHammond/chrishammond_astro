I'm really not a conspiracy theororist, not in the least bit. But you have to wonder with something like the <A href="https://www.cnn.com/2005/US/01/10/nuclear.submarine.update/index.html">U.S.S. San Francisco &#8220;running aground&#8221;</A> and killing one person, injuring 20 others, if there is really more involved here.
