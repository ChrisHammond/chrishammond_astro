<P>So we decided a 7am departure was a lot nicer than a 4am departure, so we headed out. Gas mileage dropped quite a bit, 19-21mpg with the trailer in tow.</P> <P>Stopped a few times, had lunch just south of Nashville, then I see it. The Jack Daniel's Distillery signs, I HAVE to go, I've never been, always wanted two. Two hours later we've hit the distillery and gift shop, picked up some shirts, and a newly released 1954 Belgium Gold Medal bottle. Didn't get to take the tour, will have to do that soon!</P> <P>Back on the road, who would have thought Chattanooga Tennessee would have a rush hour? This is some beautiful country, we both commented on living here sometime. Made it to atlanta just after 7pm, forgot about the time change. Got registered, dropped off the trailer, walked the course three times. Pretty simple course, easy to remember, but will catch you if you take it too lightly.</P> <P>We'll see how tomorrow goes.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P>
