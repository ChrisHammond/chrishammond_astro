<P>We went and watched War of the Worlds last night, and with all the hype of Tom Cruise lately, the movie sucked.</P> <P>It just didn't come off well, and was kind of annoying.</P> <P>Dakota Fanning's character, about drove me insane, annoying little girl. It is definitely NOT worth the $19 I spent on tickets (8.50 each plus a stupid $2 service fee for buying online)</P>
