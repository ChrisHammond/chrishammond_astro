<P>I must say, Southwest Airlines has got to have the most attractive female flight attendants of all the airlines.</P> <P>I made it from Manchester New Hampshire to Baltimore. I have a flight from Baltimore to St. Louis in 50 minutes, from the crowd gathered near the gate I don't think it'll be that full a flight, which will be nice.</P>
