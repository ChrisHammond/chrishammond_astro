<P>I went to try to burn two episodes of a show off of my Tivo box to DVD yesterday but realized that my trial version of Sonic's MyDVD software for the new Tivo2Go service had expired. Today I started searching around for options and came across this <A href="https://q.queso.com/archives/001606">interesting little fact</A>&nbsp;found via the <A href="https://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/02/sonic_mydvd_and.html">PvrBlog</A>. I guess I'm going to have to do a little more research and figure out to remove this, and use another option for burning my programs to DVD.</P> <P><A href="https://www.evillabs.net/tivo/">Will test this tonight, see if this is a good way around Sonic's software</A>.</P>
