<P>So, ever since google earth came out I've been trying to find a satellite photo of one of my cars.</P> <P>Well, I found MSN's Virtual Earth this evening and I think I've found one!</P> <P>Here's a link to Swank, follow Walnut Place west of Jefferson, out in front of the second building (swank being on jefferson as building number 1) just out of the shadows&nbsp;there's a white car, with a black top. I believe that's my old Camaro Z-28.&nbsp; I could be wrong, and this could be a really old picture, but looking on the eastern wall of that second building is a black area between the building and the parking lot, I believe that's the left over asphalt from the Swank wiring project.</P> <P><A href="https://virtualearth.msn.com/default.aspx?cp=38.629829|-90.217363&amp;style=h&amp;lvl=19&amp;sp=adr.1705%20N%20Pine%20St%2C%20Rolla%2C%20MO%2065401|adr.11421%20Manchester%20Rd%2C%20St%20Louis%2C%20MO%2063122|adr.201%20S%20Jefferson%20Ave%2C%20St%20Louis%2C%20MO%2063103&amp;v=1">https://virtualearth.msn.com/default.aspx?cp=38.629829|-90.217363&amp;style=h&amp;lvl=19&amp;sp=adr.1705%20N%20Pine%20St%2C%20Rolla%2C%20MO%2065401|adr.11421%20Manchester%20Rd%2C%20St%20Louis%2C%20MO%2063122|adr.201%20S%20Jefferson%20Ave%2C%20St%20Louis%2C%20MO%2063103&amp;v=1</A></P>
