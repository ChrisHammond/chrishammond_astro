<P>So far this weekend has been a good one. Last night we setup the <A href="https://www.soloperformance.com">SoloPerformance.com</A> store at the Midnight Madness drag races out at Gateway. I shot some video of the StreetFighterz out there having a blast on their bikes. You can <A href="https://www.christoc.com/video/streetFighterz.wmv ">download it here</A>, but be warned, it's 25megs and in Windows Media format.</P> <P>Today Rabid and I headed to Kansas City to watch the Cards game. It was amazing seeing so many Cardinals fans there, I&nbsp; think it was easily split 50/50 between red and blue in the stadium. The ride back was wet. Somehow a big storm front totally missed KC but covered 70 the whole way back. </P>
