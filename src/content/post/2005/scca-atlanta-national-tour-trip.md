excerpt: "After our impressive showing at the Arkansas National Tour in mid-March, my co-driver (Andy Hohl) and I decided we needed to go to the Atlanta National tour in early April to compete against 2 of the best drivers in the country, whom we knew would be competing in B-Stock at the Atlanta National Tour. I ended up getting a hitch built by Tuxedo Park Racing for the Project Z just in time to get the solo2.org tire trailer hooked up and loaded with two sets of tires to haul down to Atlanta.  The trip down was interesting. We (not me and Andy) left around 7:15, Andy I believe left around 8:30 or 9am on Friday morning. On the way down we stopped a few times for gas and restrooms, along with lunch at the Cracker Barrel just south of Nashville. Once we left Nashville I started seeing them. The signs for Lynchberg Tennessee. I HAD to stop, even if only for a few minutes, I had to go there. So we did, and it was 2 hours out of the way, but it was well worth it!    After the trek to Lynchberg we got back on the road and continued on to Atlanta, with our stops and the time change it was a 12 hour trip, 11 hours according to central time.  Andy and I were anxious to see how we would do against Sam Strano and Carter Thompson, both of whom have won SCCA National Championships, and would be good bars to measure ourselves against. We wanted to find out just how far we had come, and how far we still have to go early in the season. It turned out to be a great experience. After the first day Andy was sitting in third, just behind&nbsp;Strano who was sitting just behind Thompson, I was just a few thousands behind Andy for the day, in 4th in the final trophy position of the 11 car class. The second day turned out even better, Andy ended up with the fastest time in B-STock for the day, I ended up with third fastest time only 16 thousand behind Sam Strano for the day. Though we were much closer to both Sam and Carter we ended up all staying in the same finishing order for the weekend, earning Andy his 3rd National Tour trophy, and myself a second NT trophy. We're looking forward to the Midiv event in Oklahoma City at the end of April. We probably won't see any National level events until early July at the Peru National..."
