<P>Read up on the lawsuit and settlement here.</P> <P><A href="https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/departments/gc/tuition/settlement.shtml">https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/departments/gc/tuition/settlement.shtml</A></P> <P>My impression of the settlement, if you went to school at a U of Missouri system school between 1/1995 and 8/2001 you may be eligble for a $500 scholarship each semester for the next 25 years, if you choose to take more classes.</P>
