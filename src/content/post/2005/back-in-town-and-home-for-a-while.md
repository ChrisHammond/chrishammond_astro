<P>I am back in Kirkwood again, and home for a while! It's been a long few days, blizzard in Boston, drove to Springfield last night for a presentation on <a title="DotNetNuke.com" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">dotnetnuke</a>, and then a long drive back home.</P> <P>Nothing planned for the next few weeks! I've just gotta work on a few web sites and work on both cars. Time to relax a bit.</P>
