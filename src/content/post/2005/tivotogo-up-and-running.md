<P>I went home for lunch today and find a new message on my Tivo box. I check it, low and behold, <A href="https://www.chrishammond.com/archive/2005/01/03/448">it was updated to 7.1 last night</A>, which is the upgrade to the TivoToGo service!</P> <P>I was going home with the intentions of watching Lost, but only got to see about 30 minutes of the episode because I started transfering last night's episode to my PC via TivoToGo, when I get home this evening I'll see what all I can get it to do with that episode, as well as finish watching it.</P>
