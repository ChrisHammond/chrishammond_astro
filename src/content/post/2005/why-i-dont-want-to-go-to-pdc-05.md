<P>Well, I was going to do this blog post as my entry in the &#8220;blog your way to the PDC&#8221; but after doing a bit of research, I actually don't want to go to PDC 05 in LA.</P> <P>Here's why. The PDC&nbsp;is being held September 13-16th 2005, which is exactly the time frame I will be in Topeka Kansas at&nbsp;the SCCA Solo&nbsp;Nationals.&nbsp;Andy and I have a good shot at performing well in the car there this year, so I would hate to miss a trophy (hopefully) at Nationals to go to a developers conference! </P> <P>So, I challenge Microsoft to move the PDC to the following week! Then I will re-enter myself in the &#8220;blog your way to the PDC&#8220; with my original intention of using the PDC as an excuse to <A href="https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=79591">road trip</A> from St. Louis to California in my 350Z, blogging and taking photo graphs along the way!</P><A href="https://channel9.msdn.com/pdc/pdcfriends.aspx?contest=true"><IMG alt="blogging my way to pdc" src="https://channel9.msdn.com/pdc/Flairs/Blogmyway-v.jpg" border=0> </A>
