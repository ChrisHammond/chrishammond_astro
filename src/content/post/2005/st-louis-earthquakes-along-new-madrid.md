CNN has an article about <A href="https://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/06/22/new.madrid.quake/index.html">earthquakes along the New Madrid fault</A>. It's an interesting read, though not likely. I guess I can say I'm just glad to not work downtown anymore! and I'll keep parking the Tbird in the carport and the Z in the driveway!
