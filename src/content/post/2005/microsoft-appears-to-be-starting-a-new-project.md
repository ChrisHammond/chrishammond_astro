<P>Check out the <A href="https://www.start.com/3/">Start.com preview</A> site that MS appears to be working on. They appear to even have a <A href="https://spaces.msn.com/members/startcom/blog/cns!1pTNqgeSRxwfEFK-lp62aiFQ!180.trak">project blog</A> going.</P> <P>A quick glance and the site looks like it could be pretty cool, wonder how long before it will actually go live.
