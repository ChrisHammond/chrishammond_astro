<P>Get it while you can!</P> <P><A href="https://www.kmart.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=139470&amp;N=0&amp;Nty=1&amp;Ntk=All&amp;Ntx=mode%20matchallpartial&amp;Ntt=xbox%20360">https://www.kmart.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=139470&amp;N=0&amp;Nty=1&amp;Ntk=All&amp;Ntx=mode%20matchallpartial&amp;Ntt=xbox%20360</A></P> <P>I purchased a little Ebay fodder this evening. We'll see if with the Holiday season I can't get $5-600 for a $399 system.</P> <P>Scratch the above, Kmart.com sold out of the premium systems, they still have a few core systems left for $299</P>
