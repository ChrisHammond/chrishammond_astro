<P>It looks like I got out of St. Louis just in time! All sorts of chaos downtown today as the Praxair Distribution facility blew the hell up!</P> <P><A href="https://www.wmbtech.com">Bill</A> posted a message over on another site about being able to see the flames from the Swank Parking lot, and hearing the explosions. Wow, wonder what the heck happened.</P> <P><A href="https://www.ksdk.com/news/photogallery.aspx?gid=81102&amp;pid=6">Check out some of the pictures</A>. From the news video I saw here in Salina Kansas I could see quite a few vehicles burning, and no fire department vehicles around to put them out. I think they cleared out the area and were letting things burn. Amazing that no one was hurt.</P>
