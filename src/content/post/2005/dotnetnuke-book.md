I've been in a few magazines, this will be my first book besides credits in some The Sporting News publications while I worked there.</P> <P><A href="https://wroxblog.typepad.com/minatel/2005/05/professional_ne.html">Found a blog by WROX, looks like the book won't be in my hands for another week :(</A></A></P>
