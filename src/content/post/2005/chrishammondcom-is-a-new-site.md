Well, I've been using Community Server on a few other websites, most notably SCCAForums.com, since May. So I decided it was finally time to upgrade ChrisHammond.com to CS 1.1. You'll see a few changes here over the next few days, look/feel, and links, etc. The galleries were the biggest change, they are still there, but not in the same format as before, so things are probably going to be lost on the search engines for a few weeks while I get google to reindex the website! More to come!
