<P>Since I posted the video it's been downloaded over 12k times, sucking up more than 80gb of traffic on my interland hosting account. Tonight it appears to be moving rather slow, either from lots of downloads, or they've throttled my bandwidth.</P> <P>I've got incoming links to the video ALL over the place. The <A href="https://www.mjmorningshow.com/cc-common/feeds/view.php?feed_id=263&amp;feed=/mainfeed.html&amp;instance=1&amp;article_id=16174">MJ Morning Show</A> even picked up the link! Plus 100's of other web message boards. I'll try to post some of the other links soon!</P>
