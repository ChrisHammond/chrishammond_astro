<P>On nightline tonight there was a story about a girl named Sarah Reinertson, she's 30, and only has one leg.</P> <P>She attempted the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii last year, she made it to the transition after the bike ride, but was 15 minutes too late to go on the run.</P> <P>The show is still on, but I believe she's going to attempt the triathlon again this year. It really makes you think about life when you see what she does. She's got this challenge she has to live with every day, and she has the drive to be able to compete in this hardcore event.</P> <P>&nbsp;</P><IMG src="https://www.cannondale.com/bikes/racing/images/gallimgs/tri/sara_sm.jpg">
