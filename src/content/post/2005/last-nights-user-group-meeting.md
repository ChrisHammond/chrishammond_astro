<P>Last night's user group meeting ended up getting started around 6:20, maybe closer to 6:30. We left the building just after 9. I tell ya, my voice was about done with after those 2.5 hours, even though I had a glass of water there to try to help keep my throat going.</P> <P>I covered ALOT of information, I felt a lot better about this presentation then I did the one I had in Springfield earlier this year. I tried to stay more in line with the Powerpoint (any interest to make that downloadable?) as to not veer off topic too far and cover some of the key features of <a title="DotNetNuke.com" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">dnn</a>. After finishing up with the power point I started working more with an actual <a title="DotNetNuke.com" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">dnn</a> install and showing the capabilities and how to use <a title="DotNetNuke.com" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">dnn</a> out of the box. I really could have talked for another 8 hours on how to use <a title="DotNetNuke.com" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">dnn</a>, I know this because I've done 3 days of training on <a title="DotNetNuke.com" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">dnn</a> before, so trying to fit the key points and functionality into a few hours is tough.</P> <P>Hope everyone walked away with a better understanding of <a title="DotNetNuke.com" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">dnn</a>, and hopefully I generated some more local interest for the project!</P>
