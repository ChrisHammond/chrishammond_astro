<P>Tomorrow night is the annual St. Louis region of the SCCA's awards banquet. It's almost always guaranteed to be a good time!</P> <P>I'll be picking up my B-Stock Class championship tomorrow, then drinking heavily and heading out to who knows where afterwards. The party usually goes well into the morning hours.</P> <P><A href="https://www.solo2.org/gallery/albums/6.aspx">See some of the photos of my 2003 Nissan 350Z here!</A>&nbsp;</P>
