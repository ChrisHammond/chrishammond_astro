<p>It's time for this thing to go. I have no desire to work on it, I'm in the market for another old bug, or a bike, not sure which yet.</p> <p>1988 Ford Thunderbird TurboCoupe</p> <p>2.3 Turbo 4 cylinder. Runs great, needs some interior love though.</p> <p><a target="_blank" href="https://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=4589780459"><font size="2">https://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=4589780459</font></a></p> <p>Located in Manchester Missouri. If the highest bid on this thing is $20 it's gonna sell for $20, I'm not pulling it from the auction.</p> <p><strong>THIS CAR SOLD LONG AGO quit asking me if it is still for sale</strong></p>
