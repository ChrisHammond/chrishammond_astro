<P>This is going to be a busy week from the looks of things!</P> <P>I'm thinking that there will be a release candidate coming from both <A href="https://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2005/01/27/rumors_of_my_demise_have_been_greatly_exaggerated">Telligent Systems for their Community Server solution</A>, and from the <a title="DotNetNuke.com" href="https://www.dotnetnuke.com/" target="_blank">dotnetnuke</a> team.</P> <P>I've also been working heavily on <a title="DnnCart.com" href="https://www.dnncart.com/" target="_blank">DnnCart</a> and a web site for a client. The Client's site is about finished and ready to go. <a title="DnnCart.com" href="https://www.dnncart.com/" target="_blank">DnnCart</a> is getting close to being ready for an upgrade for SoloPerformance.com. I hope to have more of a test site for SPS up and running later this week for people to demo. Currently I have it running so that I can test and place orders.</P>
