I got <A href="https://www.wonderfulcrazy.com/">the domain and web site</A> setup for Faye and James on Thursday evening. She even made her <A href="https://www.wonderfulcrazy.com/blogs/fayes_blog/archive/2005/02/12/34.aspx">first blog post</A> and <A href="https://www.wonderfulcrazy.com/photos/">uploaded some pictures</A> already! I think she get's her geekiness from her dad.
