excerpt: "For those of you who recieved business cards with information about photos taken at the SLADS show this past weekend I'll have those up over the next few days.

I also have some video taken from Sunday of people, I'll send information for that out as well. Before I can send you your username/password though I need your email address! So use the contact form here on this site to send me your email address and I'll email you later this..."
