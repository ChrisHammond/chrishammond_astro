This post is mainly for search indexing, but have you seen the new <A href="https://www.sccaforums.com/">SCCAForums.com</A>? After over a year of putting it off waiting for good software (<A href="https://www.communityserver.org/">communityserver</A>) and over a month of hard work, I got the new <A href="https://www.sccaforums.com/">SCCAForums.com</A> launched this past weekend. Check it out! Many more enhancements are coming!
