excerpt: "https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/archive/2005/08/24/423620.aspx So here's how the story goes. Back in May I signed up to take the exam 70-315 (Developing and Implementing Web Applications with Microsoft Visual C# .NET and Microsoft Visual Studio .NET), I signed up for a test date in July. I had never taken an MS exam, or even looked at a sample question, so I posted the following thread. https://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/archive/2005/06/28/416289.aspx While there were some good sugggestions, I ended up postponing my test date to 8/23 because work was extremely busy (still is) and I hadn't prepared for the test at all.

I emailed my boss, told him I'd f'd up, was going to fail this test if I even went to take it, not knowing if I'd be able to even go due to the work load right now. I called the proctor for the test, he said I could come in anytime before 5pm, so I could make it to the 1:30pm meeting at a client site that had been scheduled at 11am that morning. I went from the client site, still, having not prepared, with no clue what I was about to get into. I got there at 3pm, and had 2 hours to take the test. 59 minutes later I was done. I thought, oh well, good practice at least, and I'd get to use the free retake of the test that MS had been offering when I signed up. I pressed done, and boom, \"Congratulations you've passed!\" Needless to say, I was a bit suprised, but stoked none the less.  So,&nbsp;1 test down, 2-4 more to go. Now, I think I'll definitely study for the test of..."
