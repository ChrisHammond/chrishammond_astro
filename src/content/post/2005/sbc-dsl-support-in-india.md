<P>Something tells me, the guy's name that I just talked to at SBC for the problems with my DSL line was not "Sam".</P> <P>At least with Charter Pipeline here in St. Louis Missouri whenever I called their support line I got someone who's native language was english, and most of the time I got someone who was actually within a twenty mile radius of my house, not half way across the world. It's always easier talking to someone who understands you, rather than is just reading from a script. Which is exactly what he was doing, I just chose to cut him off and make him not use the script.</P>
