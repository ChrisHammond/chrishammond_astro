<P>I'm currently looking for the proper downloads to upgrade my MPX200 to WM2003. Motorola released the phones with WM2002 and there have been no officialy upgrades available but from what I've been reading on the net there's an upgrade to WM2003 floating around. I've found a few sites that apparently have it, but they're bandwidth limited daily, so i'll have to try them again tomorrow early and see if I can't get the files.</P> <P>It'll be interesting to have the phone on WM2003 so I can finally write .Net apps for it!</P>
