Two of my blogs, this one, and over at <A href="https://www.dnncart.com/blogs/christoc/"><a title="DnnCart.com" href="https://www.dnncart.com/" target="_blank">DnnCart</a>.com</A> were hit by comment spam from one IP address yesterday. About 11-12 comments each, all on extremely old posts. <A href="https://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/posts/3361.aspx">Scott blogs about his tactics for battling comment spam</A>. If things keep up as they were yesterday I'll look to move this site over to CommunityServer 1.0 far sooner than planned.
