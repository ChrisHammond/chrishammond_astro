<P>Slashdot had an article about a<A href="https://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/07/17/problogger-slashdotted/"> guy who claims to make&nbsp; $15k a month at blogging</A>, and has quite a few comments from people who believe he's full of shit.</P> <P>I think it's highly possible that he may be making that much. Just a bit of info, I'd estimate I'm making $50 a month at blogging, sometimes a little less though, and July appears to be lacking in the Google Adsense, so I'll have to see why that may be. Maybe it just means I need to blog more!</P> <P>Edit: Figured out that part of the reason July's $$$ is down is because the blogs over at Solo2.org have had some issues as of late and have been turn off for ~two weeks. They are back up, so hopefully they start to drive up traffic again.</P>
