<P>I don't think Lawmakers really think of the impact that something like <A href="https://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/07/22/congress.daylighttime.ap/index.html">changing daylight savings time</A> will really have.</P> <P>Millions of lines of computer code will most likely need to be rewritten now. Every app that ever took DST into account now must change, good idea folks.</P>
