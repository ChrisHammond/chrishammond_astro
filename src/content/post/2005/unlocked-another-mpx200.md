<P>Since my MPX200 is about to die, the sound cuts out quite frequently, I picked up Dave's old phone this weekend. I just unlocked it today so that I can use&nbsp; it with my current t-mobile service. </P> <P>If you're looking to unlock an MPX200 check out <A href="https://www.imei-check.co.uk">https://www.imei-check.co.uk</A>&nbsp;they provided great/quick/cheap service and the phone is unlocked!</P> <P>I&nbsp;have now done a hard reset to reflash the phone and get rid of all Dave's old info on there, time to get it up and running. How do you do a hard (master)&nbsp;reset? Remove the battery, hold the blue button down, put&nbsp;the battery back in and press the power button. You'll be prompted from there.</P>
