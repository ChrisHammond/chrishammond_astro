excerpt: "Well, I'm still without power at home. Ameren has a convenient little outage map to show you all their customers without power. From the stats, it looks like 1/8th of everyone in the 63122 Zip code is still without power.     63122 1347 8860 Hopefully it will be back online tonight. I was running an import process into Engage over the weekend so I can do a mailing for SCCAForums.com tomorrow, but I have no idea if the import completed or not before the power went out. If the power is still out this evening i'll just bring in the machine I was using at home to work and power it up here. On another note, related to the recent storms, the gallery at solo2.org has died while the power for that server shutoff over the weekend. I'll be trying to get it back up later..."
