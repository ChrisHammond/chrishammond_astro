<P>So last night was the big Contender Finale.</P> <P>I must say I was highly dissappointed. Technically it was a horrible production, camera views sucked during the fights, Sly was an damn idiot &#8220;I want a rematch. I want to see a rematch&#8221; before the damn fight even started, then every two minutes throughout the match. There were multiple times when the sound was off, microphones off when they should have been on, on when they should have been off.</P> <P>The fights weren't very good either. Jesse got slaughtered by Gomez. I don't know why, Jesse has a hell of a punch, I'm not a boxing expert by any means, but it looked like he really wanted to land his devastating uppercut and was unable to do so, over and over again. Congrats to Gomez, he faught a good fight.</P> <P>The main bought, between Peter Manfredo Jr. and Sergio Mora was just as dissappointing. Manfredo looked to tire out after about the first round. He spent the next 6 rounds hugging Mora with his head down the whole time. Mora even got the point where he was talking shit to Mandredo's family in the corner, very low class of him if I must add.</P> <P>The fights in the past episodes were much better produced, which I guess comes with the ability to cut and edit them, as they weren't shown live. The effects that Burnett and his team were able to convey with the heavy punches in slow motion in the past episodes made for much more entertaining fights.</P> <P>Over all, the show was fun, I watched about half of the season. Up until the last episode last night I thought very highly of it all. Last night though was very dissapointing. I guess it shows why boxxing isn't all that interesting straight out of the box.</P>
