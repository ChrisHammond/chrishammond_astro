<p>Vintage Super 8 video from 1972 shot by Bill Hammond.</p>  <p>Transferred by projecting on a wall and recording with iPhone 11 Pro Max. Hopefully in the future I&#39;ll get a better digitization of the footage, without the dog making appearances.</p>  <p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5eZuIxd-Z8" width="560"></iframe></p>
