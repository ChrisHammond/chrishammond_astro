excerpt: "In honor of our state's 200th birthday, we'd like to share a simple salute with you. Our Tennessee Bicentennial Bottle is a replica of the Centennial Decanter Mr. Jack designed back in 1896. And, like the decanter the whiskey inside has remained true to the original except for one special difference-it's bottled at 96 proof in honor of this bicentennial year.&nbsp;Here's to the enduring spirit of Tennessee tradition.&nbsp;1796-1996 "
