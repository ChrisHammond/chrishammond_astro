<p>Somehow, during two of my recent DotNetNuke upgrades, from 9.4.1 and 9.4.4 to 9.5, I started to experience some weird problems. The one I spent a few hours on this evening was that the Module Actions menu (module settings, export content, import content, help, print, develop, delete, refresh) was simply missing.</p><p>When mousing over the Gear icon in the actions menu for the Module, I was presented with the MOVE action menu items</p><p><a href="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//open-live-writer/dnn-module-actions-menu-items-are-missin_14fba/actionsmissing_2.png"><img width="142" height="244" title="actionsmissing" style="display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="actionsmissing" src="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//Open-Live-Writer/DNN-Module-Actions-Menu-items-are-missin_14FBA/actionsmissing_thumb.png" border="0"></a></p><p>When mousing over the MOVE menu, I was presented with long list of BLANK menu items.</p><p>Digging around I didn’t have much luck figuring out what the cause was. I tried changing the skin, changing containers (for the page), added a new page, tested different modules, always the same result. I even had this happening on multiple portals in that same install.</p><p>Ultimately I started looking at the HTML source code of the page and noticed that the JSON for the "adminActions: [{"Actions":[],"ID":12,"Visible":true,"" started at ID 12 or 13 depending on the portal, which made me think that there was something missing in the back end, not on the front end items.</p><p>That let me to a search for the term “adminactions”, looking at ModuleActions.ascx I searched for AdminActionsJSON and the reference at <a href="https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/blob/c35fdc7fb75db0438f3b872ce4e279e3ea73e7c2/DNN%20Platform/Website/admin/Menus/ModuleActions/ModuleActions.ascx.cs#L159">https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/blob/c35fdc7fb75db0438f3b872ce4e279e3ea73e7c2/DNN%20Platform/Website/admin/Menus/ModuleActions/ModuleActions.ascx.cs#L159</a>&nbsp;</p><p>That let me to look in the App_GlobalResources folder in the root of my troubled site, and the realization that GlobalResources.resx file was missing. I uploaded that file via FTP to the folder, and the Module Actions on the page started working again. From there I went into the module settings (which I couldn’t access easily before) and found this:</p><p><a href="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//Open-Live-Writer/DNN-Module-Actions-Menu-items-are-missin_14FBA/EmptyActions_2.png"><img width="244" height="113" title="EmptyActions" style="display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="EmptyActions" src="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails//Open-Live-Writer/DNN-Module-Actions-Menu-items-are-missin_14FBA/EmptyActions_thumb.png" border="0"></a></p><p>That led me to the realization that I was missing a LOT more resource files, that’s why most of the above screenshot was blank.</p><p>Something went wrong with my upgrade, actually both upgrades I did, where I had these odd random files “missing” after the upgrade. To fix this instance, I uploaded all the 9.5 UPGRADE files again, except for the INSTALL folder.</p><p>If someone else ever experiences this problem, hopefully this post will help them track it down faster than it took me to resolve.</p>
